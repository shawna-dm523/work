#### User Experience



Various UX exercises. The card sorting one was so popular at my then-job, that we brought it back a few times for team-building exercises.

#### Edits

This is an edit of the original where I attempt to create a version that is cleaner and easier to read. The edit was designed to be more visually compelling and short enough so that readers, who often simply scan through texts, would choose to read the entire article.
