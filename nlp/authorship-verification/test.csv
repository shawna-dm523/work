1600,"But it was. He proved it to me—or I proved it to us. At some stage you have to get excited about it, if it's no more than a grisly fascination. At that, it was dawn before we could stop our intoxicated talk. Maragon had been yanked out of bed again, and when he heard the news, woke up a darned sight faster than the night before. Pheola of the race-horse legs joined us, and several other psis as well. Before it was over the Grand Master had put on a ridiculous piece of regalia and mumbled me into probationary membership in the Lodge. [SNIPPET] ""How—?"" I said, but Artie was already figuring it out, aloud. ""It's the soundwaves,"" he said. "" At ultrasonic, molecule-disrupting vibrations, they're doing just what that Philosopher's Stone was supposed to: Transmuting. Somehow, we didn't clean out the reflector sufficiently, and some of the traces of our other trial insulations remained inside. The ceramics formed the bowl, the metals formed the spoon, the cornflakes formed the cornflakes!"" ""But,"" I said logically (or as logically as could be expected under the circumstances), ""what about the rubber, or the fabrics?"""
1601,"it mounted now above that line of metal stages in the distance. And as Grantline gestured, I saw from Venus the same sword-like beam streaming off almost to cross our own. Grantline and I, with a mutual thought, ran around the balcony and gazed to where Mars had set. A narrow radiance was streaming up among the stars off there. Three swinging swords of light in the sky! [SNIPPET] Give her another five now to Mars, and five in port. That's ten. We'll pick her signals in three weeks, mark me!"" ""Three weeks."
1602,"It certainly didn't bother me or hold me back. I started to make money as though I had my own printing press and managed to hang onto most of it. In spite of what the doom criers say, as long as there is an element of freedom in this country—and I think there always will be—there will be ways, and I mean legal ways, of coming into large hunks of cash. Within ten years, I was not only Big Rich; I was one of the most important people in the world. [SNIPPET] I am informed that UPREA Government sources are attributing these disappearances to us. I can only say that I am sincerely sorry that this is not the case. K     Wu Fung Tung to Vladmir N. Dzhoubinsky:"
1603,"There the devastation was even more thorough, if less spectacular. Dry earth churned like mud, and rock shards weighing tons bumped and rolled about like pebbles as they shivered and cracked into pebbles themselves. "" It looks like sand dancing in a child's sieve,"" said the normally impassive Schwartzberg in a nationwide broadcast from the scene of disaster. "" No one here has ever seen anything like it."" And the landslip was growing, north and south along the Fault. ""Get out while you can,"" Schwartzberg urged the population of the affected area. "" When it's over you can come back and pick up the pieces."" But the band of scientists who had rallied to his leadership privately wondered if there would be any pieces. [SNIPPET] ""Sure,"" Vernher laughed. "" If we go back to savage pre-civilization."" ""All right,"" George said. "" I'll go tell Rosy. Watch the control panel a moment, will you? Especially the Eastern Section."""
1604,"You saw that he had put away the exterior of mirth that hospitality demanded of him, and perturbation showed in the lean countenance which was by ordinary so proud and so amiably peevish.  ""Robin, you have performed many mad actions in your life!"" he said; ""but this return into the three kingdoms out-Herods all! Did I not warn you against Umfraville!""  ""Why, certainly you did,"" returned Mr. Calverley. "" You informed me—which was your duty as a friend—of this curmudgeon's boast that he would have me horsewhipped if I dared venture into England. You will readily conceive that any gentleman of self-respect cannot permit such farcical utterances to be delivered without appending a gladiatorial epilogue. [SNIPPET] They were just prefacing actual physical torture with hellish mental torture, that was all. That he was right in his guess was proved in a few moments. He heard a louder hiss from the great lizard so near him. Opening his eyes, he saw the Rogan leader in the process of forcing the serpentine neck to withdraw foot by foot back into the doorway, using his shock-tube as a sort of distant prod. The monster swayed its ugly flat head back and forth, hissing deafeningly at the sting of the tube, now and again lunging with its vast unseen body at the too narrow entrance that kept it from entering the laboratory. Dex could hear the foundation walls of the building creak at the onslaught of that tremendous weight. If it would only break through!"
1605,"Eh? Let us say they suspect each other. Naturally, each has disclaimed any part of the deed. But the suspicion is there, that tiny seed; and suspicion, particularly where love is involved, has a habit of taking root and giving growth. [SNIPPET] I looked away at last, back at the sea, puzzled and disturbed. I had never been aware of anything so fine as this before, nor of anything so painful. Suddenly I found myself wanting to be something, to do something—not for myself, but for her. It was strange. ""Come,"" she said at last, ""we had better go back."" ""I'd like to stay here forever,"" I answered moodily, glancing around a last time at the versatile horizon. ""So would I,"" she admitted."
1606,"Now watch. Damn—all we can do is watch,"" Grant gritted between his teeth. Down sped the gleaming liner, pride of the fleet. The men at the mirror were swerving it on gimbals until a ray from it flashed on the burnished nose. [SNIPPET] ""You needn't bother; I have a carbon copy,"" Dacre told him. "" We've all read it. If you did, at the time you suppressed it, you should have known what Doctor Chalmers said in class."" ""I knew he'd talked a lot of poppycock about a man who was still living having been shot to death,"" Whitburn retorted. "" And if something of the sort actually happened, what of it? Somebody's always taking a shot at one or another of these foreign dictators, and they can't miss all the time."" ""You claim this was pure coincidence?"" Fitch demanded. "" A ten-point coincidence: Event of assassination, year of the event, place, circumstances, name of assassin, nationality of assassin, manner of killing, exact type of weapon used, guards killed and wounded along with Khalid, and fate of the assassin."
1607,"What now?"" asked Robin, turning to his companion. Had they taken the wrong turn and come to a dead end? Korree went over to the water pool. He gestured at it, made motions of holding his breath. "" We go down in here, move under and come up ... out."" He waved a hand in a down-and-under gesture. Robin looked into the water. [SNIPPET] How is life on Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?"" He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. "" I don't understand. Mars?"
1608,"It may be put down as morally ascertained that towards all these weaknesses of humanity, and others like unto them, he held an attitude which was less that of the unassailable philosopher than that of the sympathiser, indulgent and excusing. In regard more especially to what are commonly called moral delinquencies, this attitude was so decided as to shock some people even in those days, and many in these. Just when the first sheets of this edition were passing through the press, a violent attack was made in a newspaper correspondence on the morality of Tom Jones by certain notorious advocates of Purity, as some say, of Pruriency and Prudery combined, according to less complimentary estimates. Even midway between the two periods we find the admirable Miss Ferrier, a sister of Fielding's own craft, who sometimes had touches of nature and satire not far inferior to his own, expressing by the mouth of one of her characters with whom she seems partly to agree, the sentiment that his works are ""vanishing like noxious exhalations."" Towards any misdoing by persons of the one sex towards persons of the other, when it involved brutality or treachery, Fielding was pitiless; but when treachery and brutality were not concerned, he was, to say the least, facile. So, too, he probably knew by experience—he certainly knew by native shrewdness and acquired observation—that to look too much on the wine when it is red, or on the cards when they are parti-coloured, is ruinous to health and fortune; but he thought not over badly of any man who did these things. Still it is possible to admit this in him, and to stop short of that idea of a careless and reckless viveur which has so often been put forward. In particular, Lady Mary's view of his childlike enjoyment of the moment has been, I think, much exaggerated by posterity, and was probably not a little mistaken by the lady herself. [SNIPPET] said another. “ His wit,” replied the chairman, “is too subtle to be perceived.”  A third mouth was just open, when the exercise was suddenly interrupted by the dreadful cry of “Fire!” which issued from the kitchen, and involved the whole college in confusion. Every man endeavoured to be the first in making his exit, the door and passage were blocked up; each individual was pommelled by the person that happened to be behind him."
1609,"Wherever I looked eyes dropped and timid hands fidgeted as their owners backed off from my dangerous enthusiasm. There was obviously no help to be had from them, and meantime the precious moments were flying, so with a disdainful glance I turned on my heels and set off alone as hard as I could go for the harbour.  But it was too late. I rushed through the marketplace where all was silent and deserted; I ran on to the wharves beyond and they were empty save for the litter and embers of the fires Ar-hap's men had made during their stay; I dashed out to the landing-place, and there at the hythe the last boat-loads of the villains were just embarking, two boatloads of them twenty yards from shore, and another still upon the beach. This latter was careening over as a dusky group of men lifted aboard to a heap of tumbled silks and stuffs in the stern such a sweet piece of insensible merchandise as no man, I at least of all, could mistake. It was Heru herself, and the rogues were ladling her on board like so much sandal-wood or cotton sheeting. I did not wait for more, but out came my sword, and yielding to a reckless impulse, for which perhaps last night's wine was as much to blame as anything, I sprang down the steps and leapt aboard of the boat just as it was pushed off upon the swift tide. Full of Bersark rage, I cut one brawny copper-coloured thief down, and struck another with my fist between the eyes so that he went headlong into the water, sinking like lead, and deep into the great target of his neighbour's chest I drove my blade. Had there been a man beside me, had there been but two or three of all those silken triflers, too late come on the terraces above to watch, we might have won. [SNIPPET] He became aware of some faint, remote, dark specks floating lightly through the outer air. They came down towards him, fitfully, eddyingly, and passed aside out of the uprush from the fan. A gleam of light flickered, the specks flashed white, and then the darkness came again. Warmed and lit as he was, he perceived that it was snowing within a few feet of him.  Graham walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again. He saw the head of a man pass near. There was a sound of whispering. Then a smart blow on some metallic substance, effort, voices, and the vans stopped. A gust of snowflakes whirled into the room, and vanished before they touched the floor. “"
1610,"And now I've ripped a hole in that!"" He gives a strangled hoot and goes hightailin' outta here like somepin' was after him. Jumps in his car and roars off down the road and disappears. Naw, I don't mean he really disappeared—are you nuts? Just roared on down the road till he got so small I couldn't see him no more. You know—the way things do when they go farther and farther away. Happens every day; that's what us artists mean by perspective. [SNIPPET] He motioned Howard to take the path back to the ship. To Niaga he said, “If your council of elders ever gets around to meeting, you might tell them that, as far as I’m concerned, you’ve already signed the trade treaty with me. We’re leaving in the morning to register the franchise.” “You’d break your own law? You said the negotiations had to be—” [Page 22]"
1611,"Surely this is not like my husband; yet who can it be that dares pollute by the pressure of his hand my child, whose amulet should protect him from a stranger's touch? CHILD [going to his mother].—Mother, who is this man that has been kissing me and calling me his son? KING.—My best beloved, I have indeed treated thee most cruelly, but am now once more thy fond and affectionate lover. Refuse not to acknowledge me as thy husband. ŚAKOONTALÁ [aside].—Be of good cheer, my heart. [SNIPPET] Gahan turned upon his thoat and looked at the man. He was a splendid looking fellow, resplendent in the gorgeous trappings of an Odwar, the five brilliant feathers which denoted his position rising defiantly erect from his thick, black hair. In common with every player upon the field and every spectator in the crowded stands he knew what was passing in his Chief's mind. He dared not speak, the ethics of the game forbade it, but what his lips might not voice his eyes expressed in martial fire, and eloquently: ""The honor of the Black and the safety of our Princess are secure with me!""  Gahan hesitated no longer. "" Chief's Odwar to Princess' Odwar's fourth!"" he commanded. It was the courageous move of a leader who had taken up the gauntlet thrown down by his opponent.  The warrior sprang forward and leaped into the square occupied by U-Dor's piece."
1612,"upon thy lips.— If I do, said I, I shall perish;—so I took her by the hand, and led her to the door, and begg’d she would not forget the lesson I had given her.—She said, indeed she would not;—and, as she uttered it with some earnestness, she turn’d about, and gave me both her hands, closed together, into mine;—it was impossible not to compress them in that situation;—I wish’d to let them go; and all the time I held them, I kept arguing within myself against it,—and still I held them on.—In two minutes I found I had all the battle to fight over again;—and I felt my legs and every limb about me tremble at the idea. The foot of the bed was within a yard and a half of the place where we were standing.—I had still hold of her hands—and how it happened I can give no account; but I neither ask’d her—nor drew her—nor did I think of the bed;—but so it did happen, we both sat down. I’ll just show you, said the fair fille de chambre, the little purse I have been making to-day to hold your crown. So she put her hand into her right pocket, which was next me, and felt for it some time—then into the left.—“She had lost it. ”—I never bore expectation more quietly;—it was in her right pocket at last;—she pull’d it out; it was of green taffeta, lined with a little bit of white quilted satin, and just big enough to hold the crown: she put it into my hand;—it was pretty; and I held it ten minutes with the back of my hand resting upon her lap—looking sometimes at the purse, sometimes on one side of it. A stitch or two had broke out in the gathers of my stock; the fair fille de chambre, without saying a word, took out her little housewife, threaded a small needle, and sew’d it up.—I foresaw it would hazard the glory of the day; and, as she pass’d her hand in silence across and across my neck in the manœuvre, I felt the laurels shake which fancy had wreath’d about my head. A strap had given way in her walk, and the buckle of her shoe was just falling off.—See, said the fille de chambre, holding up her foot.—I could not, for my soul but fasten the buckle in return, and putting in the strap,—and lifting up the other foot with it, when I had done, to see both were right,—in doing it too suddenly, it unavoidably threw the fair fille de chambre off her centre,—and then— Yes,—and then—. Ye whose clay-cold heads and luke-warm hearts can argue down or mask your passions, tell me, what trespass is it that man should have them? [SNIPPET] I am no wiser than I was, quoth my uncle Toby—returning his pipe into his mouth.——Then let the corporal go on, said my father, with his medical lecture.—The corporal made a bow to his old friend, Dr. Slop, and then delivered his opinion concerning radical heat and radical moisture, in the following words. THE city of Limerick, the siege of which was begun under his majesty king William himself, the year after I went into the army—lies, an’ please your honours, in the middle of a devilish wet, swampy country.—’Tis quite surrounded, said my uncle Toby, with the Shannon, and is, by its situation, one of the strongest fortified places in Ireland.—— I think this is a new fashion, quoth Dr. Slop, of beginning a medical lecture.—’Tis all true, answered Trim.—Then I wish the faculty would follow the cut of it, said Yorick.—’Tis all cut through, an’ please your reverence, said the corporal, with drains and bogs; and besides, there was such a quantity of rain fell during the siege, the whole country was like a puddle,—’twas that, and nothing else, which brought on the flux, and which had like to have killed both his honour and myself; now there was no such thing, after the first ten days, continued the corporal, for a soldier to lie dry in his tent, without cutting a ditch round it, to draw off the water;—nor was that enough, for those who could afford it, as his honour could, without setting fire every night to a pewter dish full of brandy, which took off the damp of the air, and made the inside of the tent as warm as a stove.—— And what conclusion dost thou draw, corporal Trim, cried my father, from all these premises?"
1613,"""But Gloria, think of the publicity ... the big parade with the man from Mars! Why your play would run for years!"" ""OK, I'll do it!"" she said with a big smile and watched the ad-men's gloomy faces change to astonished delight. "" There's just one little thing ... if I win!"" She prodded Harry in the chest with a long stiff finger. [SNIPPET] That night McIlvaine was more than usually diffident. He was not like a man bearing a message of considerable importance to himself. He slipped into Bixby's, got a glass of beer, and approached the table where his friends sat, almost with trepidation. ""It's a nice evening for May,"" he said quietly. Richardson grunted. Leopold said, ""By the way, Mac, whatever became of that star of yours? The one the papers wrote up."""
1614,"I confess that my conversation with Aph-Lin, and the extreme coolness with which he stated his inability to control the dangerous caprice of his daughter, and treated the idea of the reduction into a cinder to which her amorous flame might expose my too seductive person, took away the pleasure I should otherwise have had in the contemplation of my host’s country-seat, and the astonishing perfection of the machinery by which his farming operations were conducted. The house differed in appearance from the massive and sombre building which Aph-Lin inhabited in the city, and which seemed akin to the rocks out of which the city itself had been hewn into shape. The walls of the country-seat were composed by trees placed a few feet apart from each other, the interstices being filled in with the transparent metallic substance which serves the purpose of glass among the Ana. These trees were all in flower, and the effect was very pleasing, if not in the best taste. We were received at the porch by life-like automata, who conducted us into a chamber, the like to which I never saw before, but have often on summer days dreamily imagined. It was a bower—half room, half garden. The walls were one mass of climbing flowers. The open spaces, which we call windows, and in which, here, the metallic surfaces were slided back, commanded various views; some, of the wide landscape with its lakes and rocks; some, of small limited expanses answering to our conservatories, filled with tiers of flowers. [SNIPPET] its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary—Love—the true, the divine Eros—the Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus—is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the harmony manifest.  We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven—in the volutes of the flower—in the clustering of low shrubberies—in the waving of the grain-fields—in the slanting of tall eastern trees—in the blue distance of mountains—in the grouping of clouds—in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks—in the gleaming of silver rivers—in the repose of sequestered lakes—in the star-mirroring depths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds—in the harp of Bolos—in the sighing of the night-wind—in the repining voice of the forest—in the surf that complains to the shore—in the fresh breath of the woods—in the scent of the violet—in the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth—in the suggestive odour that comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans, illimitable and unexplored."
1615,"Armitage ducked and Bishop tackled me. ""Thanks, dear,"" Max said thoughtfully, looking at the cards scattered on the floor. "" We would have been set one trick. Club finesse fails."" ""She's crazy!"" Armitage's mouth worked. "" [SNIPPET] The most dangerous animal seems to be a two-foot-tall arthropod. They're rare and peaceable. Bishop vivisected one yesterday and found nothing alarming. Last night I dreamed about the first expedition. I dreamed they all committed suicide because Epsilon was too good for them. This is ridiculous! We're working in a sort of quiet madness getting no closer to the solution."
1616,"In my excitement I ran frantically to and fro about the island, calling him by name, shouting at the top of my voice the first words that came into my head. But the willows smothered my voice, and the humming muffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet round me. I plunged among the bushes, tripping headlong, tumbling over roots, and scraping my face as I tore this way and that among the preventing branches.  Then, quite unexpectedly, I came out upon the island’s point and saw a dark figure outlined between the water and the sky. It was the Swede. [SNIPPET] This unfortunate missing of the morning train even occurred again, and the firm spoke to him severely about it. But he had his consolation. Were not Arathrion and Argun Zeerith and all the level coasts of Oora his? And even as the firm found fault with him his fancy watched the yaks on weary journeys, slow specks against the snow-fields, bringing tribute; and saw the green eyes of the mountain men who had looked at him strangely in the city of Nith when he had entered it by the desert door. Yet his logic did not forsake him; he knew well that his strange subjects did not exist, but he was prouder of having created them with his brain, than merely of ruling them only; thus in his pride he felt himself something more great than a king, he did not dare to think what!"
1617,"Can it be some scientist I know nothing of is getting ahead of her? Very dishonorable of the government if so. Despite uncertainties wrote three more pages. August 11: Riots in Manchester and Birmingham. Demagogues pointing out that even if the antiGrass compound is perfected by Christmas it will be too late to save Britain. They don't count apparently on the Channel holding the plague back for long. Possible the government may fall, which won't disturb me, as I prefer the other party anyway. August 12: After a long period of silence from the Continent, Radio Mondiale went on the air from Cherbourg asking permission for the government to come to London. [SNIPPET] Brasses? To me the steel-on-steel of streetcars and El trains always sounds like trumpets and cornets. Strident, metallic, fiery cold. Hear that siren way off? It's a clarinet. The ship horns are tubas, the diesel horn's an oboe. And that lovely dreadful french horn is an electric saw cutting down the last tree. But what a percussion section they've got!"
1618,"But we, who unto other hands commit The furnishing of our immediate wants, Have a necessity more grave to meet, For which no other ever can provide, With ennui laden, and with suffering; The stern necessity of killing time; That cruel, obstinate necessity, From which, nor hoarded gold, nor wealth of flocks, Nor fertile fields, nor sumptuous palaces, Nor purple robes, the race of man can save. And if one, scorning such a barren life, And hating to behold the light of day, Turns not a homicidal hand upon Himself, anticipating sluggish Fate, For the sharp sting of unappeased desire, That vainly calls for happiness, he seeks, In desperate chase, on every side, in vain, A thousand inefficient remedies, In lieu of that, which Nature gives to all.  One to his dress devotes himself, and hair, His gait and gesture and the learned lore Of horses, carriages, to crowded halls, To thronged piazzas, and to gardens gay; Another gives his nights and days to games, And feasts, and dances with the reigning belles: A smile perpetual is on his lips; But in his breast, alas, stern and severe, Like adamantine column motionless, Eternal ennui sits, against whose might Avail not vigorous youth, nor prattle fond That falls from rosy lips, nor tender glance That trembles in two dark and lustrous eyes; The most bewildering of mortal things, Most precious gift of heaven unto man.  Another, as if hoping to escape Sad destiny, in changing lands and climes His days consuming, wandering o’er sea And hills, the whole earth traverses; each spot That Nature, in her infinite domain, To restless man hath made accessible, He visits in his wanderings. Alas, Black care is seated on the lofty prow; Beneath each clime, each sky, he asks in vain For happiness; sadness still lives and reigns.  Another in the cruel deeds of war Prefers to pass his hours, and dips his hand, For his diversion, in his brother’s blood: Another in his neighbor’s misery His comfort finds, and artfully contrives To kill the time, in making others sad. This man still walks in wisdom’s ways, or art Pursues; that tramples on the people’s rights, At home, abroad; the ancient rest disturbs Of distant shores, on fraudful gain intent, With cruel war, or sharp diplomacy; And so his destined part of life consumes.  Thee a more gentle wish, a care more sweet Leads and controls, still in the flower of youth, In the fair April of thy days, to most A time so pleasant, heaven’s choicest gift; But heavy, bitter, wearisome to him Who has no country. [SNIPPET] Presently, as Chichikov gazed about him, he saw that for some time past the koliaska had been skirting a beautiful wood, and that on either side the road was bordered with an edging of birch trees, the tenderly-green, recently-opened leaves of which caused their tall, slender trunks to show up with the whiteness of a snowdrift. Likewise nightingales were warbling from the recesses of the foliage, and some wood tulips were glowing yellow in the grass. Next (and almost before Chichikov had realised how he came to be in such a beautiful spot when, but a moment before, there had been visible only open fields) there glimmered among the trees the stony whiteness of a church, with, on the further side of it, the intermittent, foliage-buried line of a fence; while from the upper end of a village street there was advancing to meet the vehicle a gentleman with a cap on his head, a knotted cudgel in his hands, and a slender-limbed English dog by his side.  “This is my brother,” said Platon. “ Stop, coachman.” And he descended from the koliaska, while Chichikov followed his example. Yarb and the strange dog saluted one another, and then the active, thin-legged, slender-tongued Azor relinquished his licking of Yarb’s blunt jowl, licked Platon’s hands instead, and, leaping upon Chichikov, slobbered right into his ear.  The two brothers embraced."
1619,"her grandmother cried. "" It's blood that counts. If the blood is strong enough, things dissolve. They're just garbage, all those things, floating on the surface of our history. It's our history that's deep. That's what counts."" ""You're afraid of Sam,"" the young woman accused. ""Not afraid of any man!"" [SNIPPET] ""That's why you're afraid of him,"" Simone said. "" Not because I'm weak, and he might take something away from me, but because he's strong, and he might give us something. Then everything would change, and you're afraid of that. Nina might be our change."" She pointed toward the garden. Following the white line of her granddaughter's finger, Cecily looked out into the garden and saw Nina turn toward them as though she knew they were angry. The child pointed with one finger directly at them in the house."
1620,"I fostered the persuasion that you would now retire to bed; but presently you approached the closet, and detection seemed to be inevitable. You put your hand upon the lock. I had formed no plan to extricate myself from the dilemma in which the opening of the door would involve me. I felt an irreconcilable aversion to detection. Thus situated, I involuntarily seized the door with a resolution to resist your efforts to open it.  ""Suddenly you receded from the door. This deportment was inexplicable, but the relief it afforded me was quickly gone. You returned, and I once more was thrown into perplexity. The expedient that suggested itself was precipitate and inartificial. [SNIPPET] ""I turned: It is forbidden to describe what I saw: Words, indeed, would be wanting to the task. The lineaments of that being, whose veil was now lifted, and whose visage beamed upon my sight, no hues of pencil or of language can pourtray.  ""As it spoke, the accents thrilled to my heart. "" Thy prayers are heard. In proof of thy faith, render me thy wife."
1621,"Through trouble,” was her answer. He had treated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his cruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying nobody, because, so she was wont to say, she herself had been through every possible misfortune.  Sylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress’ shuffling footsteps, hastened to serve the lodgers’ breakfasts. Beside those who lived in the house, Mme. Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals; but these externes usually only came to dinner, for which they paid thirty francs a month.  At the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven inmates. [SNIPPET] Thy throbbings cease! Naught can requite thy miseries; Nor is earth worthy of thy sighs. Life is a bitter, weary load, The world a slough. And now, repose! Despair no more, but find in Death The only boon Fate on our race bestows! Still, Nature, art thou doomed to fall, The victim scorned of that blind, brutal power That rules and ruins all.  At times thy image to my mind returns, Aspasia. In the crowded streets it gleams Upon me, for an instant, as I pass, In other faces; or in lonely fields, At noon-tide bright, beneath the silent stars, With sudden and with startling vividness, As if awakened by sweet harmony, The splendid vision rises in my soul."
1622,"If Esrov doesn't want to talk to me, jets to him, but I think I have some information he can use."" ""Will you please hold on, Mr. Swenson? I will convey your message."" Swenson looked at O'Toole for a moment in silence. "" No, I don't like eggs for eating. [SNIPPET] SENATOR HIRAM C. H ""And that, Mister Cerobie,"" said Swenson, ""is how you slide out of a jam. You'll get enough cash for that snuff haul to Mars to pay the crew of Number 5 when she lands there. And you'll have enough left over to pay the demurrage and repair charges at Luna. Now open me a beer."""
1623,"It had powerful fanged jaws and its eight feet were armed with knifelike, disemboweling claws. As it came at Ed in a lumbering rush, another came crawling out after it. Ed shot four times, as fast as he could work the action. The heavy slugs did the job, but not quite well enough. With its dying lunge the thing got to him and tossed him ten feet like a rag doll. He lit on his bad hand and felt the wrist bones go. As he struggled to get up, digging his elbow in and using one hand, he saw a stinger darting in at him. [SNIPPET] It ventured out and found a few morsels, but the organized hunting network it ordinarily maintained had been disrupted, it had lost track of things, and the pickings were poor. Then it stumbled on the rabbit Ed had staked out. Its first impulse was to leave the rabbit strictly alone. In spite of its early promise, the other world had so far given nothing but trouble. On the other hand, the rabbit was meat, and very good meat, by the smell and looks of it. The Harn kept its observation unit prowling irresolutely around the target for half the night before it finally gave in to appetite and sent in a stinger to finish the rabbit off, a carrier to pick it up. It was still uneasy about this when it noticed Ed near the nest the next morning, confirming its fears."
1624,"The bag weighed less than twenty. It will go miles beyond the reach of any airplane before it settles into an orbit around earth."" ""Well, there goes my dreamed-of fortune,"" I said sadly. "" Accompanied by the fading strains of an unplayed wedding march. I'm sorry, Joyce."" ""Isn't there one thing you folks are overlooking?"" asked Sandy Thomas. "" My goodness, you'd think we had lost our last cent just because that little old bag flew away!"" [SNIPPET] But I doubt it. She won't even let me try to support her."" ""I'm serious, Mr. Mallory. Do you think she could lift you with one hand?"" ""Don't be silly! Of course not."
1625,"The next morning, when I was well-groomed, Polly and Dolly came into the yard to see me and make friends. Harry had been helping his father since the early morning, and had stated his opinion that I should turn out a “regular brick”. Polly brought me a slice of apple, and Dolly a piece of bread, and made as much of me as if I had been the “Black Beauty” of olden time. It was a great treat to be petted again and talked to in a gentle voice, and I let them see as well as I could that I wished to be friendly. Polly thought I was very handsome, and a great deal too good for a cab, if it was not for the broken knees.  “Of course there's no one to tell us whose fault that was,” said Jerry, “and as long as I don't know I shall give him the benefit of the doubt; for a firmer, neater stepper I never rode. We'll call him 'Jack', after the old one—shall we, Polly?”  “Do,” she said, “for I like to keep a good name going.” [SNIPPET] Giles had a horse given him and rode the way by Ralph.  They rode up and down the hills and dales, but went across country and not by the Greenway, for thuswise the road was shorter.  But when they had gone some two leagues, and were nigh on top of a certain low green ridge, they deemed that they heard men's voices anigh and the clash of arms; and it must be said that by Ralph's rede they journeyed somewhat silently. So Ralph, who was riding first with Giles, bid all stay and let the crown of the ridge cover them. So did they, and Giles gat off his horse and crept on to the top of the ridge till he could see down to the dale below. Presently he came down again the old face of him puckered with mirth, and said softly to Ralph: ""Did I not say thou wert lucky? here is the first fruits thereof. Ride over the ridge, lord, at once, and ye shall have what there is of them as safe as a sheep in a penfold."""
1626,"Pheola laid a hand on his chest—she seemed to have a better feel after a touch, just as I do with the weights. There was a dead silence in the room as she stood there, eyes closed, and slowly ran her fingers over his rib cage. After some minutes her eyes opened, and she came back to my side. ""Still the same,"" she said. [SNIPPET] The shutters blinked, sending pulses of light down the length of the ten-foot diameter glass-walled tube in which the men were working. Far down the tube, MacHeath could see the answering flicker from Harry, a mile and a half away in the darkness. MacHeath watched the screen again. After a few seconds, he said: ""O.K.! Hold it!"" Again the lamp flashed. ""Well, it isn't perfect,"" MacHeath said, ""but it's all we can do from here. We'll have to evacuate the tube to get her in perfect balance. Tell Harry to knock off for the day."""
1627,"The doctor cleared his throat. "" Small amounts in hors d'oeuvres at cocktail parties."" ""Well, maybe I'm just a country boy but the stuff tastes like fish eggs to me. Anyway, to get back to the story...."" He'd gone into Tiffany's and into some of the other swank shops. And then into a bank or two, and stared at the treasures of Manhattan. At this point he looked at Ross. "" You know, just being invisible don't mean all that. [SNIPPET] ""Yes, and I'll repeat it under narco-hyp, too,"" Tortha Karf added. ""Oh, don't talk that way, Karf,"" Dalgroth Sorn scolded. He was at least a century Tortha Karf's senior; he had the face of an elderly and sore-toothed lion. "" You wanted to keep this prisoner under wraps till you could mind-pump him, and you wanted the Organization to think Salgath was alive and talking."
1628,"I'll explain it."" He could feel himself alive at that moment, every nerve singing, every muscle toned. His brain was quick and his tongue rolled the words out smoothly. This was the kind of situation Heidel handled best. A tense, dramatic situation, full of atmosphere and suspense. ""Here it is,"" Heidel continued, ""simply and briefly."" [SNIPPET] Yes, we've got milkers and shuckers, and we've got hatchers for the chickens. We've got tractors and combines and threshing machines. They're all mechanical, all right. But we don't have mechanical farmers, yet. The pumps, the tractors, the milkers don't work by themselves. In time, maybe."
1629,"Either he simply didn't want to answer, or else he wasn't on the machine in person but was playing an impression-tape on my wave-band. I tried again. You're licked, you know. Already you're licked. Even if my call to Newell was nothing but a telenosis dream—even if no one knows anything about this but me, you're still licked— No reply. None of any kind. I'd expected at least to get a sinister chuckle, or a flood of horrors. [SNIPPET] Two dogs had yapped at my heels. The ""police"" vehicle was unmarked—unusual if not illegal. When I looked at the driver, he was not, of course, a policeman. He was one of Grogan's bodyguards—the one into whose arms I had thrown Maxwell not long ago. He was staring straight ahead at the road, his spread-nosed face composed. He hadn't noticed anything. I took a deep breath and leaned back again, half-closing my eyes. But I did not relax. The clicking of the defense mech seemed thunderous to me, but if the driver heard it, he gave no indication."
1630,"""Aye, my lord. All I have to do is set up the screen and light the lantern in the projector."" ""Go ahead, then."" He looked back at Father Bright and the Countess. "" Master Sean has a rather interesting lantern slide I want you to look at."" ""The most successful development I've ever made, if I may say so, my lord,"" the sorcerer said. [SNIPPET] It's much too delicate for that."" ""Don't fool yourself, mister. Horses can stand a lot of leather."" ""Not the horse, stupid,"" I said. "" The bat."
1631,"At the end of the corridor she was able to stand on her feet again, although she still had to walk very carefully. Any sudden movement sent her soaring in a graceful leap that banged her head against the ceiling. Cautiously she opened a thick, metal door into another hall—and she stood transfixed, looking through a mica wall at the emptiness of space pinpointed with its billions of stars. This was the reality of the charts she had seen in the astronomy text: that knowledge alone saved her sanity. She had believed it when the proof lay hidden above the rain mist; she must believe it now. From where she stood, she was able to see the place where the god-car had brought her—like a vast cartwheel spinning in the void. The god-car was clamped against the hub, from which eight corridors radiated outward like wheel spokes toward the rim. [SNIPPET] Nevertheless, Doctor, it is damned unnerving to come out of ultradrive a couple of hundred million miles from the first star ever visited by man and have to turn tail and run because the damned thing practically blows up in your face."" Leicher could see that Benedict was upset; he rarely used the same profanity twice in one sentence. They had been downright lucky, at that. If Leicher hadn't seen the star begin to swell and brighten, if he hadn't known what it meant, or if Commander Benedict hadn't been quick enough in shifting the ship back into ultradrive—Leicher had a vision of an incandescent cloud of gaseous metal that had once been a spaceship. The intercom buzzed. The commander answered, ""Yes?"" ""Sir, would you tell Dr. Leicher that we have everything set up now?"""
1632,"Why, I can remember the day when that would have tickled you to death."" ""You followed the digging of the Tube, didn't you?"" ""Yes, of course."" ""You remember the volcano and lava seams?"" ""Yes."" [SNIPPET] I made out a minority report. I can do no more."" ""Dutch, you are becoming over-cautious. First sign of old age."""
1633,"Oh, I say, wasn't he a grand old boy! Look!"" For, transfiguring Abel Reeling's form as a prophet's form is transfigured in the instant of his rapture, flooding his brain with the white eureka-light of perfect knowledge, that for which he and his dream had been at a standstill had come. He knew her, this ship of the future, as if God's Finger had bitten her lines into his brain. He knew her as those already sinking into the grave know things, miraculously, completely, accepting Life's impossibilities with a nodded ""Of course."" From the ardent mouths of her eight furnaces to the last drip from her lubricators, from her bed-plates to the breeches of her quick-firers, he knew her—read her gauges, thumbed her bearings, gave the ranges from her range-finders, and lived the life he lived who was in command of her. [SNIPPET] ""Just before you.""  ""In that grove of trees?"" inquired the girl. And really, it seemed to her that they were approaching a beautiful grove."
1634,"I must have fallen off the couch, finally, and broken the wires, which stopped the machine. Anyway, I came to to find you lying beside me on the floor. Whatever was the idea of bashing me?"" A flood of red suddenly rose to her cheeks. "" [SNIPPET] She smiled at him even more brightly. "" What's stupid about it?"" He stared at her, then suddenly grinned back. "" Okay, you're ribbing me. But dammit, you let a guy like Brannan soft-soap you and squire you all around the town, and eat it up, and when I pay you a legitimate compliment, you act like ... like a woman!"" ""I'm sorry, Mr. Jensen, sir,"" she said. "" I didn't mean to forget we are working in a scientific laboratory and that you are my boss. We are both men, working on a man's job—"" He groaned. """
1635,"I'd rather ... tell him myself."" ""Thanks,"" said Miss Eagen flatly. Marcia felt as if she'd been slapped. Miss Eagen dried her hands and crossed to an intercom. "" [SNIPPET] ""Listen, I have no time—"" Crag started to growl. His words were clipped short as his eyes involuntarily took the reading of his oxygen gauge. Low ... low. He calculated quickly. He was well past the point of no return—too low to make the long trip back to Bandit."
1636,"Mr Stiles being a man somewhat versed in town life, had an impression of his own dignity, and did not quite like leaving his pastor under the erroneous idea that he being a churchwarden kept the children in order during church time. ' Twas thus he understood Mr Arabin's allusion to his severity, and hastened to put matters right by observing that 'Sexton Clodheave looked to the younguns, and perhaps sometimes there maybe a thought too much stick going on during sermon.' Mr Arabin's bright eye twinkled as he caught that of the archdeacon; and he smiled to himself as he observed how ignorant his officers were of the nature of their authority, and of the surveillance which it was their duty to keep even over himself. Mr Arabin read the lessons and preached. It was enough to put a man a little out, let him have been ever so used to pulpit reading, to see the knowing way in which the farmers cocked their ears, and set about a mental criticism as to whether their new minister did or did not fall short of the excellence of him who had lately departed from them. A mental and silent criticism it was for the existing moment, but soon to be made public among the elders of St Ewold's over the green graves of their children and forefathers. The excellence, however, of poor old Mr Goodenough had not been wonderful, and there were few there who did not deem that Mr Arabin did his work sufficiently well, in spite of the slightly nervous affection which at first impeded him, and which nearly drove the archdeacon beside himself. [SNIPPET] Now, indeed, they might reckon with safety on their good fortune. But what if it all had been lost? What if her fourteen bairns had been resteeped to the hips in poverty by the morbid sentimentality of their father? Mrs Quiverful was just at present a happy woman, but yet it nearly took her breath away when she thought of the risk they had run."
1637,"""But unfortunately, a simple computation showed that if Mr. J664M42721Male married Miss T246M42652Female, and was blessed by a child by the year 2921, which year marked the thousandth year since the deposit of the John Jones Dollar, then in that year there would be due the child, the following amount: ""It simply showed beyond all possibility of argument, that by 2921 A.D., we would be $474,758,637.85 shy—that we would be unable to meet the debt to John Jones the fortieth. ""I tell you, gentlemen, the Board of Directors was frantic. Such wild suggestions were put forth as the sending of an expeditionary force to the nearest star in order to capture some other Solar System and thus obtain more territory to make up the deficit. But that project was impossible on account of the number of years that it would have required. [SNIPPET] You see, since the beam is moving sidewise very rapidly at that range and we're shooting at a small target, the message has to be very short or they won't get it all while the beam's on 'em—it isn't as though we were broadcasting. It doesn't need any address, because nobody but the Sirius can receive it—except possibly the Jovians. They'll know who's sending it without any signature. It tells them that Ganymede wants to receive a message on the ultra-band centering on forty-seven thousandths. Isn't that enough?""  ""Maybe. But suppose some of them live right here on Ganymede—you'll be shooting right through the ground all night—or suppose that even if they don't live here, that they can find our beam some way? Or suppose that Brandon hasn't got his machine built yet, or suppose that it isn't turned on when our beam passes them, or suppose they're asleep then?"
1638,"It is a phrase, my Lord, that I believe you taught us. I will try to help you—” “All right, all right!” The Visitor cut in impatiently. “ Stop the chatter and let me be on my way. [SNIPPET] Two or three little bits of the cord chipped off and drifted away. Tremont realized that it was frozen and brittle. He redoubled his efforts. After a few minutes of clumsy clicking of fingertips against thumbs, he strained to pull his hands apart."
1639,"Harry leveled the rifle. "" I'm not sick,"" he muttered. "" I know what I'm doing. And I know all about you, too. You're one of them, aren't you? One of the first of Leffingwell's brood of illegitimates."" [SNIPPET] “Gustaf Adolf is a good king, but there are limits,” Eklund observed. “There are other considerations,” Christianson replied. “ After all, Edie is the reason the Crown Prince is still alive, and Gustaf is fond of his son.” “After all these years?” Christianson smiled. Swedish royalty was long-lived. It was something of a standing joke that King Gustaf would probably outlast the pyramids, providing the pyramids lived in Sweden. “"
1640,"And art thou dead, indeed, O my beloved? and am I still alive? And was it, then, in heaven decreed, that this, Thy tender body the last damps of death Should feel, and my poor, wretched frame remain Unharmed? Oh, often, often as I think That thou no longer livest, and that I Shall never see thee on the earth again, Incredible it seems! Alas, alas! What is this thing, that they call death? [SNIPPET] On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf; scattered around, were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’ Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally. But it is by no means a really natural arrangement. I should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot. In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons. ‘ There was evidence,’ it is said, ‘of a struggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,’—but the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves. ‘ The pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended."
1641,"As far as Mattern was concerned, they did fabulously well, because he had to make enough on his side to counterbalance the entire expenses of a planet on the other. The thought impressed him. I am, in a sense, equal to the mbretersha, he thought, and she is a monarch. As a result, he walked a little more erect than even the operations had rendered him. The dangers of his trade grew less and less frightening as he came to know his way between the universes, even though, at the same time, he began to realize how great those dangers were. He had not conceived of their immensity before. [SNIPPET] It seems to me that emotions must originate in a physical being; perhaps reason could be free, but not emotion. I don't know. But I have a theory. I believe our physical selves still exist somewhere in space."
1642,"And it won't do you any good to report it, because no one is going to take the word of a fool like you, against a respected council member. They'll think you are the dishonest one. Now, give me that Key!"" It's a terrible thing to disobey a council member. But if I obeyed him, I would be disobeying all the others. And that would be worse. ""No!"" I shouted. [SNIPPET] That was because I caught small animals and brought them to her. Not having to depend on what she could catch, she grew almost twice as fast as usual, and was so sleek and pretty. Really, she was a pet to be proud of. I don't know how I could have stood the four months there alone, if I hadn't her to talk to. I don't think she really understood me, but I pretended she did, and that helped. Every three or four weeks, three of the council members came to take a part of the Treasure, or to add to it."
1643,"Upon this notion we purpose calling that towards the east the anode155, and that towards the west the cathode156; and whatever changes may take place in our views of the nature of electricity and electrical action, as they must affect the natural standard referred to, in the same direction, and to an equal amount with any decomposing substances to which these terms may at any time be applied, there seems no reason to expect that they will lead to confusion, or tend in any way to support false views. The anode is therefore that surface at which the electric current, according to our present expression, enters: it is the negative extremity of the decomposing body; is where oxygen, chlorine, acids, &c., are evolved; and is against or opposite the positive electrode. The cathode is that surface at which the current leaves the decomposing body, and is its positive extremity; the combustible bodies, metals, alkalies, and bases, are evolved there, and it is in contact with the negative electrode. 664. I shall have occasion in these Researches, also, to class bodies together according to certain relations derived from their electrical actions (822.); and wishing to express those relations without at the same time involving the expression of any hypothetical views, I intend using the following names and terms. [SNIPPET] 1477.), they are frequently related; and circumstances may be so arranged that they shall be isochronous, occurring in equal numbers in equal times; or shall occur in multiples, i.e. with two or three negatives to one positive; or shall alternate, or be quite irregular. All these variations I have witnessed; and when it is considered that the air in the vessel, and also the glass of the vessel, can take a momentary charge, it is easy to comprehend their general nature and cause.  * * * * * 1506. Similar experiments to those in air (1485. 1493.)"
1644,"John Drinkard was thick and blocky, with big hands and a square chin. Chuck Evers was long and sinewy. Beside them, Royston seemed a pale, slight figure, his thin face sallow, his shoulders ever hunched against the crisp western air. ""You are speaking of the land I love,"" said Chuck Evers. "" If you don't like it, why stay around?"" Royston shrugged. "" [SNIPPET] He was frightened, and again I was surprised without having any right to be. I tried to keep at least my voice calm. ""Please try it anyhow, Mr. Braun—as a favor. It's already too late to do it any other way. And if you guess wrong, the outcome won't be any worse than if you don't try at all."" ""My kids,"" he whispered. I don't think he knew that he was speaking aloud."
1645,"We'll give them a real show!"" He dived downward, back into the battle. It was a show, all right! It was impossible to fight the Earth ship. The enemy had to concentrate four magnetic rays on it to use their electric weapon, and they could only do that by sheer luck! And even that was of little use, for they simply lost one of their own ships without harming the Ancient Mariner in the least. Ship after ship crumpled in on itself like crushed tinfoil or hurled itself violently to the ground as the molecular beams touched them. The Satorian fleet was a fleet no longer; it was a small collection of disorganized ships whose commanders had only one thought—to flee! The few ships that were left spearheaded out into space, using every bit of acceleration that the tough bodies of the Satorians could stand. [SNIPPET] She looked down. He was out there somewhere, going about his mysterious business. The smile she thought of as soft and tender was really brittle and quite hard. She downed her drink thirstily as though it helped quench the fever in her throat. She put the glass down and heard a whisper: ""John, John, why don't you come to me? I'll help you."
1646,"""I can't. But all of us together can."" ""No sense,"" the woman said, wagging her head. "" No sense."" ""It's sense, all right. [SNIPPET] ""Ah, a dog. Must have jumped off the crystal. You can have him sent on for three hundred and—"" ""Young man, if any harm comes to my Violet—I'll—I'll—I'll appeal to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals!"" ""Very good, madam. We appreciate your patronage."" The door flew open again. A very fat woman, puffing angrily, face highly colored, clothing shimmering with artificial gems, waddled pompously out of the door through which the frantic French doctor had so recently vanished."
1647,"Yet he couldn't refuse. That would be discourteous and offensive, and one simply didn't offend the natives. The BEE was explicit about that. Courtesy was a watchword on Niobe. He took a place by the fire, watching with concealed distaste as one of the hunters reached into the boiling vat beside the firepit with a pair of wooden tongs and drew forth the native conception of a hors d'oeuvre. [SNIPPET] All dead— No! He slammed at the bulkhead until the warped metal gave and he ran to the control room. The Crew—the Crew— He stared at the tank. Through a jagged opening in the ship's walls, the wind whined and plucked at Kelly's red hair."
1648,"He was at the supply bin—like an old-fashioned wood bin; a box with a sloping flap lid. Deliveries of food and clothing and home medicines and other things were left here. You wrote down what you needed, and they left it—or whatever they allowed you—with a bill. You paid the bill by leaving money in the bin, and the next week you found a receipt and your new stuff and your new bill. And almost always you found some money from the government, for not planting wheat or not planting corn. [SNIPPET] He gave a startled leap forward, and whirled, looking up into the face of the mailed figure with the confused idea that it had reached down and struck him. It had not moved, of course. And Stark knew, with no need of anyone to tell him, that he looked into the face of Ban Cruach. It was a face made for battles and for ruling, the bony ridges harsh and strong, the hollows under them worn deep with years. Those eyes, dark shadows under the rusty helm, had dreamed high dreams, and neither age nor death had conquered them."
1649,"“Yes,” he said; “my friends have been making me take up golf this term, and I mean to go to the East Coast—in point of fact to Burnstow—(I dare say you know it) for a week or ten days, to improve my game. I hope to get off tomorrow.”  “Oh, Parkins,” said his neighbour on the other side, “if you are going to Burnstow, I wish you would look at the site of the Templars’ preceptory, and let me know if you think it would be any good to have a dig there in the summer.”  It was, as you might suppose, a person of antiquarian pursuits who said this, but, since he merely appears in this prologue, there is no need to give his entitlements.  “Certainly,” said Parkins, the Professor: “if you will describe to me whereabouts the site is, I will do my best to give you an idea of the lie of the land when I get back; or I could write to you about it, if you would tell me where you are likely to be.”  “Don’t trouble to do that, thanks. It’s only that I’m thinking of taking my family in that direction in the Long, and it occurred to me that, as very few of the English preceptories have ever been properly planned, I might have an opportunity of doing something useful on off-days.”  The Professor rather sniffed at the idea that planning out a preceptory could be described as useful. [SNIPPET] Don’t lose your heads. You stay out here with the light, landlord, and one of you two men break in the door, and don’t go in when it gives way.”  The men nodded, and the younger stepped forward, raised his crowbar, and dealt a tremendous blow on the upper panel. The result was not in the least what any of them anticipated. There was no cracking or rending of wood—only a dull sound, as if the solid wall had been struck."
1650,"Just what did he do?"" ""The Secret Service reports he spent the day whistling Mother Machree and playing with his dog, cat and mouse."" ""Dog, cat and mouse? I say!"" blurted Sir Alfred. The President was defensive. "" He had to have some occupation, and he seems to be particularly interested in our animal life. [SNIPPET] Paul grinned at me. "" I see you read the same poxy stuff I do."" A Moorish girl went by dressed in a neatly tailored gray jellaba, European style high-heeled shoes, and a pinkish silk veil so transparent that you could see she wore lipstick. Very provocative, dark eyes can be over a veil. We both looked after her. I said, ""Or, here's another one. Suppose you have a very advanced civilization on, say, Mars."" ""Not Mars. No air, and too bloody dry to support life."""
1651,"""Careful,"" warned Janus. "" Remember, it may be sacred."" As I walked away, I heard Allenby say, ""Take some scrapings from the inside of the hole, Gonzales. We might be able to determine if anything is kept in it...."" One of the stumpy, purplish, barrel-type cacti on the ridge had a long vertical bite out of it ... as if someone had carefully carved out a narrow U-shaped section from the top down, finishing the bottom of the U in a neat semicircle. It was as flat and cleancut as the inside surface of a horseshoe magnet. [SNIPPET] Then to Sanders' plantation."" ""O.K., boss; hold tight."" He had the car up to ten thousand feet. Aiming it in the map direction of Qualpha's Village, he let go with[Pg 126] everything he had—hot jets, rocket-booster and all. The forest landscape came hurtling out of the horizon toward them. Qualpha's was where the trouble had first broken out, after the bug-out from Sanders; the troops hadn't been able to get there in time, and it had been burned. Another village, about the same distance south of the plantation, had also gone up in flames, and at a dozen more they had found the natives working themselves into frenzies and had had to sleep-gas them or stun them with concussion-bombs."
1652,"Isn't that wonderful? I was just a little girl when she died. I can barely remember her as a real old woman. But I remember that my grandmother never bought anything from Hartshorne-Logan because of some trouble her mother had once with the firm. My mother didn't want me to come to work here because of that."" Mr. Hawkins put his arm around Milly in a way that he intended to look fatherly. [SNIPPET] And I want to ask you a favor, Tina."" ""What, Husband?"" ""Will you undress for me now?"" ""Andy! My, my, my."" He explained the situation to her. "" Be careful,"" she said. "" I love you."""
1653,"said I, with an air of carelessness, three several times—but it would not do: every ungracious syllable I had utter’d crowded back into my imagination: I reflected, I had no right over the poor Franciscan, but to deny him; and that the punishment of that was enough to the disappointed, without the addition of unkind language.—I consider’d his gray hairs—his courteous figure seem’d to re-enter and gently ask me what injury he had done me?—and why I could use him thus?—I would have given twenty livres for an advocate.—I have behaved very ill, said I within myself; but I have only just set out upon my travels; and shall learn better manners as I get along. When a man is discontented with himself, it has one advantage however, that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain. Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chaise,—and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fittest for, I walk’d out into the coach-yard to buy or hire something of that kind to my purpose: an old désobligeant [562] in the furthest corner of the court, hit my fancy at first sight, so I instantly got into it, and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings, I ordered the waiter to call Monsieur Dessein, the master of the hotel:—but Monsieur Dessein being gone to vespers, and not caring to face the Franciscan, whom I saw on the opposite side of the court, in conference with a lady just arrived at the inn,—I drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us, and being determined to write my journey, I took out my pen and ink and wrote the preface to it in the désobligeant. It must have been observed by many a peripatetic philosopher, That nature has set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumscribe the discontent of man; she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease, and to sustain his sufferings at home. [SNIPPET] The Abbé redoubled his politeness and attentions, and took a tender interest in all that Candide said, in all that he did, in all that he wished to do. ""And so, sir, you have a rendezvous at Venice?"" ""Yes, monsieur Abbé,"" answered Candide.[Pg 117] ""It is absolutely necessary that I go to meet Miss Cunegonde."" And then the pleasure of talking of that which he loved induced him to relate, according to his custom, part of his adventures with the fair Westphalian. ""I believe,"" said the Abbé, ""that Miss Cunegonde has a great deal of wit, and that she writes charming letters?"" ""I have never received any from her,"" said Candide, ""for being expelled from the castle on her account I had not an opportunity for writing to her. Soon after that I heard she was dead; then I found her alive; then I lost her again; and last of all, I sent an express to her two thousand five hundred leagues from here, and I wait for an answer."" The Abbé listened attentively, and seemed to be in a brown study."
1654,"Give me that key."" Jane backed away. "" You—you couldn't be our pilot. If you were—"" ""The key. I don't want to hurt you."" Bartock lunged. Jane turned and ran, slamming the door behind her. It clanged, and echoed. [SNIPPET] It was almost ludicrous, since she had to help him to his feet. He staggered along with her, knowing he would never make it to Mozart's Lady and back in time. But if he left her, she was probably doomed too. He'd sacrifice his life for hers. They went a hundred yards, Mayhem gripping the blaster and advancing by sheer effort of will. Then he smiled, and began to laugh. Jane thought he was hysterical with pain. But he said: ""We're a pair of bright ones. The scout-ship."""
1655,"He cut the image. Well, this was more like it. You can't deal with Psis without the whole affair acting like something out of E. Phillips Oppenheim. I closed up the office, turned out the ceiling, and rode the elevator down to the street. The night howled and shrieked with air-borne traffic. [SNIPPET] He had no idea that he, himself, was re-channeling the energy in those machines to make them burn out."" Brian Taggert looked at MacHeath pointedly. "" Do you think the shock treatment you gave him will cause any repercussions?"" ""No."
1656,"Cully fingered the scar on his forehead, and looked unseeing into the old man's compassionate eyes. "" I'm sorry Cully. We all are. But there was no other way. Prefrontal lobotomy, destruction of your speech center ... it was the only way you could get past the telepaths and destroy them. I'm sorry, Cully. [SNIPPET] But the not-men who had hunted him would not laugh; to them, it would not be funny. They knew that it was true. And they knew he knew it was true. But why not kill him? Why this torture? Why this horrible persecution that dug into the depths of his own nightmares to haunt him? His breath came fast and a chilly sweat broke out on his forehead."
1657,"The engines continued firing, pressing the men deeper into their couches. The cabin lights flickered, went out, came on again. And still the acceleration mounted and Dierdre's engines howled in agony, thrusting the ship forward. Somers raised one leaden hand and inched it toward the emergency cut-off switch. [SNIPPET] Isn't that right?"" Dorle nodded slowly. "" The soft underbelly of the dragon. In the legend, the dragon's armor doesn't cover its stomach."" He began to laugh. "" That's right. That's perfectly right."" ""Let's go, then,"" Nasha said. "" Let's get back to the ship."
1658,"It was a mere respite. Swiftly, they checked their respective units against Cumulative Code, and at the end of thirty seconds every light went green for total clearance as ECAIAC's deep-throated power resumed. Beardsley had been waiting too. "" Cumulative!"" he breathed. He let his breath out slowly, and made a sweeping gesture that seemed to encompass all the latent delight, all the unleashed joy of his being. [SNIPPET] I say no! The risk is too great. You, Otah—and you, Gral—you will destroy this weapon. It must not be used again!"""
1659,"With the same wary prudence that characterized her whole conduct, she concealed her discovery, but hastened to remove her son from the sphere of the attractive Greek. He was sent to Cumberland; but the plan of correspondence between the lovers, arranged by Evadne, was effectually hidden from her. Thus the absence of Adrian, concerted for the purpose of separating, united them in firmer bonds than ever. To me he discoursed ceaselessly of his beloved Ionian. Her country, its ancient annals, its late memorable struggles, were all made to partake in her glory and excellence. He submitted to be away from her, because she commanded this submission; but for her influence, he would have declared his attachment before all England, and resisted, with unshaken constancy, his mother’s opposition. Evadne’s feminine prudence perceived how useless any assertion of his resolves would be, till added years gave weight to his power. [SNIPPET] I said to Rerechild at once that with such a life and such a man, Sir Omicron should be summoned—of course I knew that the expense was nothing—so distinguished, you know, and so popular. Nevertheless, all that human skill can do has been done.' Just at this period Mrs Grantly's carriage drove into the close, and the archdeacon went down to confirm the news which she had heard before. By the 9.15pm train Sir Omicron Pie did arrive."
1660,"He'd tell Gloria off. Stealing a man's penguin! He opened the door into the living room and bumped into Lucy Allison. "" Don't you think you've been in there long enough, Bill?"" she asked acridly. "" I'm sure your guests would appreciate catching a glimpse of you."" ""Why, hello, Lucy,"" he said, surprised. "" I didn't know Gloria had invited you—"" [SNIPPET] Obe the Great Bear! Now he could bring Obe many times! Even Otah the Thrower-of-Stones would be in awe! Gral lifted the thing of his creation ... and just a little way distant, his glance caught the bole of a tree. Now this will be Obe the Great Bear ... then Gral leapt forward, arm outflung in the arc he remembered. Truly and without effort the weight went to the mark. It made impact that jarred him from arm to shoulder, but this he did not mind because his weapon's edge brought a great gaping wound to the weathered bole."
1661,"He tossed aside his professorial robes. Under them Cydwick Ohms wore an ancient and bizarre costume: black riding boots, highly polished and trimmed in silver; wool chaps; a wide, jewel-studded belt with an immense buckle; a brightly checked shirt topped by a blazing red bandana. Briskly, he snapped a tall ten-gallon hat on his head, and stepped to the Time Door. Gripping an ebony handle, he tugged upward. The huge metal door oiled slowly back. "" Time,"" said Cydwick Ohms simply, gesturing toward the gray nothingness beyond the door. The reporters and photographers surged forward, notebooks and cameras at the ready. "" What if the door swings shut after you're gone?"" [SNIPPET] They had vanished, disintegrating, it seemed. He didn't then know that they were related to Topper's friends and the jeep in one thing: that their Typonisif and Tregoifer was applicable to the atmosphere. The four pillars were bending from their own weight. Strange colors—like an idiot's conception of a spectrum, spectrally rippled like irid waves across the columns. Like music in color."
1662,"He went down in a slump, completely out. Grant stooped to pick up the fallen pencil-ray, thrust it in the side flap, then hurried over to the limp figure of Nona. ""Darling,"" he cried, ""if anything's happened to you, I'll—"" The still form stirred, sat up. [SNIPPET] Their buzzing as they darted above the odorous pool of golden liquid made the sound Burl had heard. Their bodies flashed and glittered as they darted back and forth, seeking a place to alight and join in the orgy. Those which clustered about the banks of the pool were still as if carved from metal. Their huge, red eyes glowed, and their bodies shone with an obscene fatness. Flies are the most disgusting of all insects. Burl watched them a moment, watched the interlacing streams of light as they buzzed eagerly above the pool, seeking a place at the festive board. A drumming roar sounded in the air. A golden speck appeared in the sky, a slender, needle-like body with transparent, shining wings and two huge eyes."
1663,"Anything so soft, so silken as that little lady was never seen before. Who am I, a poor quarter-deck loafer, that I should attempt to describe what poet and painter alike would have failed to realise? I know, of course, your stock descriptives: the melting eye, the coral lip, the peachy cheek, the raven tress; but these were coined for mortal woman—and this was not one of them. I will not attempt to describe the glorious tenderness of those eyes she turned upon me presently; the glowing radiance of her skin; the infinite grace of every action; the incredible soul-searching harmony of her voice, when later on I heard it—you must gather something of these things as I go—suffice it to say that when I saw her there for the first time in the plenitude of her beauty I fell desperately, wildly in love with her.  Meanwhile, even the most infatuated of mortals cannot stare for ever without saying something. The grating of our prow against the garlanded side of the royal barge roused me from my reverie, and nodding to An, to imply I would be back presently, I lightly jumped on to Hath's vessel, and, with the assurance of a free and independent American voter, approached that individual, holding out my palm, and saying as I did so,  ""Shake hands, Mr. President!""  The prince came forward at my bidding and extending his hand for mine. [SNIPPET] It was none too soon for me to look to my own part; for my head was scarce back at the window, before five men, carrying a spare yard for a battering-ram, ran past me and took post to drive the door in. I had never fired with a pistol in my life, and not often with a gun; far less against a fellow-creature. But it was now or never; and just as they swang the yard, I cried out: “Take that!” and shot into their midst.  I must have hit one of them, for he sang out and gave back a step, and the rest stopped as if a little disconcerted."
1664,"There began to grow within him a sensation of too much to be done in too little time. He became frantic, his reactions were too fast! He rolled from end to middle of the board, now back-tracking, now spinning on his single wheel, turning uncertainly from one side to the other, jerking and gyrating. The conscious segment of him, remaining detached from those baser automatic functions, began to know what a man would have called fear—fear, simply, of not being able to do what must be done. [SNIPPET] ""You tell that tree your Mommie never sees strangers when Daddy isn't home!"" ""I'll make him wait!"" Stoutly your pot-bellied little protector prevents his protective mother from going to pot. ""If he won't play, I'll use my ray gun on him!"" Obviously, the tree won't play. Watch your son lift empty hands, arm himself with a weapon yet to be invented, and open fire on the advancing foe."
1665,"It circled him once, spiraled up. Behind it, like a smoke trail from a destroyer, a pale blue mist streamed backward. It surrounded the man and hid him. The bag flew back into Harse's hand. The violet mist thinned and disappeared. And the man was gone, as utterly and as finally as any chambermaid or driver of a truck. There was a moment of silence. [SNIPPET] He can NOT conceive of what is utterly beyond his range of experience and imagination—which is merely the re-arrangement of reality or of thoughts derived from reality. We are perhaps in much that same position. To be sure, our telescopes bring us data from stars that are so far away the human race will never reach them—but is not our telescope a ""screen"" that brings us only the one-inch rocks? There may be and probably is a vast realm of reality co-existent with the reality we know, right around us; but it is ""screened"" from us. It may be possible that we know less than ten percent of actual reality around us due to the screening of our senses and our instruments that blocks completely, or permits to pass completely, every energy pattern that can't pass through the ""holes"" of our ""screen."" Going back to Kah, the one-inch-rock-universe observer, suppose that in one batch of dirt dumped at the head of the screening system there happened to be no one-inch rocks at all? Or, more closely to the story you are about to read, suppose, with his mind deeply grooved with the tracks of the one-inch rocks, he were to move to a vantage point where there were no one-inch rocks, but larger or smaller ones?"
1666,"Carthoris turned the figure over upon its back. It was Jav, but torn and mangled almost beyond recognition.  The prince bent low to note if any spark of life remained, and as he did so the lids raised and dull, suffering eyes looked up into his.  “The Princess of Ptarth!” cried Carthoris. “ Where is she? Answer me, man, or I complete the work that another has so well begun.” [SNIPPET] said An, with a little warmth. "" If it comes to that, you know nothing.""  Whereat I laughed, and, saying the reply was just, vowed I would not interrupt again; so she wont on saying how Hath—that interminable Hath!—would know it all better than she did, but long ago the land was overrun by a people from beyond the broad, blue waters outside; a people huge of person, hairy and savage, uncouth, unlettered, and poor An's voice trembled even to describe them; a people without mercy or compunction, dwellers in woods, eaters of flesh, who burnt, plundered, and destroyed all before them, and had toppled over this city along with many others in an ancient foray, the horrors of which, still burnt lurid in her people's minds.  ""Ever since then,"" went on the girl, ""these odious terrors of the outer land have been a nightmare to us, making hectic our pleasures, and filling our peace with horrid thoughts of what might be, should they chance to come again.""  ""'Tis unfortunate, no doubt, lady,"" I answered. "" Yet it was long ago, and the plunderers are far away. Why not rise and raid them in turn? To live under such a nightmare is miserable, and a poet on my side of the ether has said—  It seems to me you must either bustle and fight again, or sit tamely down, and by paying the coward's fee for peace, buy at heavy price, indulgence from the victor."""
1667,"I centered the picture of the city on the crossed hairlines in the middle of my viewpoint, and watched its image grow. In about fifteen minutes the ""string"" of air balls was before the city, and speaking in my ultrophone I gave the order to halt, while I swung the scope control to the penetrative setting and let my ""eye"" rove slowly back and forth through the walls of the city, hunting for a spot from which I might get my bearings. At last, after many penetrations, I managed to bring in a view of the head of the shaft at the bottom of which I knew the tunnels were located, and saw that we were none too soon, for all the corridors leading toward this shaft were packed with Hans waiting their turn to descend. Slowly I let my ""eye"" retreat down one of these corridors until I ""pulled it out"" through the outer wall of the city. There I held the spot on the crossed hairlines and ordered Number Two Operator to my control board, where I pointed out to her the exact spot where I desired a breach in the wall. Returning to her own board, she withdrew her ball from the ""string,"" and focussing on this spot in the wall, eased her projectile into contact with it and detonated. The atomic force of the explosion shattered a vast section of the wall, and for the moment I feared I had balked my own game by not having provided a less powerful projectile. [SNIPPET] It was half an hour before he reached the village. The Wabbly had gone from end to end, backed up, and gone over the rest of it again. There was the taint of gas in the air. Sergeant Walpole halted outside the debris. His gas-mask had been blown to atoms with Observation-Post Fourteen. ""They're tryin' to beat the news o' their comin',"" he reflected aloud, ""which is why they smashed up the village. The telephone exchange was there.... Tillie's under there somewheres...."" He fumbled with the rifle, suddenly swearing queerly hate-distorted oaths. Tillie had not been the great love of Sergeant Walpole's life."
1668,"""The Smith routine is just a gag,"" Arena said. "" His name is—Maclamore."" For an instant, I thought I saw a flash of expression on Stenn's face. He crossed the room and sat down. ""Well,"" he said. "" A very rational move, your coming here. I trust you struck a profitable bargain?"" He looked hard at me, and this time there was expression. [SNIPPET] Chandler's voice answered in English, with a faint Oxford accent: ""It is I, Rosie, Kalman. Where's Koitska's tinkertoy? Oh, all right, thanks; I'll just pick it up and take it in. Hope it's all right. I must say one wearies of breaking in these new fellows."" Chandler's body ambled around to the trunk of the car, took out the square-wave generator on its breadboard base and slouched into the building. It called ahead in the same language and was answered wheezily from above: Koitska. """
1669,"The telepaths were trained to become ultrasensitive, trained to become aware of the Dragons in less than a millisecond. But it was found that the Dragons could move a million miles in just under two milliseconds and that this was not enough for the human mind to activate the light beams. Attempts had been made to sheath the ships in light at all times. This defense wore out. As mankind learned about the Dragons, so too, apparently, the Dragons learned about mankind. Somehow they flattened their own bulk and came in on extremely flat trajectories very quickly. Intense light was needed, light of sunlike intensity. [SNIPPET] Nothing stirred in Telzey's thoughts. Between them there was still no direct communication. Then how had the beings been able to get through to her? Telzey wrinkled her nose. Assuming this was real, it seemed clear that the game of symbols she'd made up between herself and TT had provided the opening. Her whole experience just now had been in the form of symbols, translating whatever occurred into something she could consciously grasp. ""Kitten-talk"" was how the beings referred to the use of symbols; they seemed contemptuous of it."
1670,"she warned. "" I'll become hysterical unless you leave."" ""Very well,"" her husband said. "" I'll come back tomorrow."" He bent as he spoke and kissed her on the forehead. His lips were ice cold. For eight years Sally sat across the table from her husband at breakfast, her eyes fixed upon a nothingness on the green-blue wall at his back. [SNIPPET] You did."" Loveral looked at what Atkinson had in his hands. He blinked. ""You're nearly dead,"" Atkinson said. Loveral looked at Atkinson, into his eyes. "" If you wanted to kill me, you could have done it some other way."" Atkinson shook his head. "" Just this way."
1671,"He had seen the order and beauty of space, the incredible perfection of the Universe, so often and so deeply that, like Beauclaire, he could not help but believe in a Purpose, a grand final meaning. When his father had died of an insect bite at Oberon he had believed in a purpose for that, and had looked for it. When his first crewmate fell into the acid ocean of Alcestis and the second died of a horrible rot, Wyatt had seen purpose, purpose; and each time another man died, for no apparent reason, on windless, evil useless worlds, the meaning of things had become clearer and clearer, and now in the end Wyatt was approaching the truth, which was perhaps that none of it mattered at all. It especially did not matter now. [SNIPPET] Do something before the others come back!"" Emmett glanced apprehensively at the air lock. She was right. At the moment they outnumbered the enemy, but when the others returned the Agronians could overpower them by sheer weight of number. And they could return without warning, at any instant. ""Why did one prevent the other from killing us?"" George asked. ""He may have been afraid the other would miss and damage the ship,"" Emmett said. "" Or possibly—"""
1672,"Moira met them in the spacious living room, her pretty face comical with surprise and dismay. ""Philip, what's happened? You look so—"" She saw the alien then and put a hand to her mouth. ""Keep her quiet while I deal with Fermiirig,"" Boyle said to Locke. "" I have no time for argument. [SNIPPET] There are suspected informers in the main office, so you are being hired in this unusual manner. Go at once to 787 Washington Street and ask for Mr. Coleman. Jon felt an immense sensation of relief. For a moment there, he was sure the job had been a false lead."
1673,"""One of us won't leave here."" Harry frowned, then tried cunning. "" Aren't you being silly? We are hopelessly marooned. [SNIPPET] Macker asked. ""No,"" Toolls said. "" That is what I want your advice about. Just how much should I reveal about ourselves and our background? Or should he be left without any knowledge of us?"" ""Well ..."" Now that the others had deferred to Macker's arguments, he had lost much of his certainty. "" Perhaps we should at least let him know who we are, and what we have done."
1674,"We clambered from the cylinder. Our guide led us down one of the gloomy metal corridors. It echoed with our tread. A door lifted. ""Daniel Dean and party."" The guard stood aside. "" Come in."" The door slid down behind us. We advanced into the small blue-lit apartment, steel-lined like a vault. [SNIPPET] But there was no giant beam from Wandl to seize them, and Wandl now could not move through space of her own volition. Like Earth, and all other known planets, satellites, comets and asteroids, she was subject now to all the normal natural laws of celestial mechanics. We had done a thorough job of it. Now I shoved at Snap. "" No time to talk. You tow the girls; I'll take Molo. Got to get to the Star-Streak."" I lunged over and seized Molo. """
1675,"You have ruined my life."" She blinked, open-mouthed. "" Ruined your life?"" ""Precisely."" [SNIPPET] He wasn't particularly alarmed about it; his arms and vision failed him too, but his brain hadn't enough incoming oxygen to care much, one way or the other. The few remaining feet seemed to lengthen into a sewerlike passageway, then vanished as did all else as his perceptions died. MacNamara was not the sort to wonder about heaven or hell when he first awoke. He saw a faintly rounded ceiling, a soft yellow tint accentuating its featurelessness. "" How the devil—"", he began. His voice failed him."
1676,"We all see that, except our dear friend here, the milk of whose nature runs so softly, that he would not have the heart to refuse the Pope, the loan of his pulpit, if the Pope would come and ask it. We must not, however, allow the man to preach again here. It is not because his opinion on church matters may be different from ours—with that one would not quarrel. It is because he has purposely insulted us. When he went up into that pulpit last Sunday, his studied object was to give offence to men who had grown old in reverence to those things of which he dared to speak so slightingly. [SNIPPET] Lawrence,’ she said, speaking quickly and in jerks, ‘dare you, for my sake, sleep this night in the cavern of the red pike? for I say to you that, faithful or not, I doubt your courage.’ But she was startled when she saw him, and how the fiery blood rushed up to his forehead, then sank to his heart again, and his face became as pale as the face of a dead man; he looked at her and said, ‘Yes, Ella, I will go now; for what matter where I go?’ He turned and moved toward the door; he was almost gone, when that evil spirit left her, and she cried out aloud, passionately, eagerly: ‘Lawrence, p. 43Lawrence, come back once more, if only to strike me dead with your knightly sword.’ He hesitated, wavered, turned, and in another moment she was lying in his arms weeping into his hair. “‘And yet, Ella, the spoken word, the thought of our hearts cannot be recalled, I must go, and go this night too, only promise one thing.’ ‘ Dearest, what? you are always right!’ ‘"
1677,"They are a pest thrice accursed. I tell Nōfūhl his fine theory concerning the extinction of the Yahnkis is a good tale for those who have never been here. No man without a leather skin could survive a second night. 18th M oor Jā-khāz is worse than sick. He had an encounter last night with a strange animal, and his defeat was ignoble. The animal, a pretty thing, much like a kitten, was hovering near when Jā-khāz, with rare courage and agility, threw himself upon it. And then what happened none of us can state with precision. [SNIPPET] How many ships in all? Nōfūhl.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mehrikans had eighty heavy ships of iron, with a number of smaller craft. The allies had two hundred and forty heavy battleships, all of iron. They also had smaller craft for divers purposes. Khan-li.&nbsp; Allah! A bad prospect for our greedy friends! And being a nation of traders they had no liking, probably, for the perils of war."
1678,"Babs was perched up there on the knee summit. His right leg was outstretched. I was at the right side of his belt. I could dart off along that curving expanse of his leg and leap to the ground. [SNIPPET] ""No, I can't do that."" Doris was firm on the point. "" The written part of the test was solely for ability to reason logically. Just among the three of us, I know some university professors who'd flunk on that. But if the rest of the tests show stability, sense of responsibility, good judgment, and a tendency to think before acting, the subject can be classified as a safe and reliable workman."" ""Well, then, let's don't say anything till we have the tests all finished,"" Keating proposed. ""No!"" Melroy cried. "" Every minute those two are on the job, there's a chance they may do something disastrous."
1679,"said Felix. ""Yes; all the people are with him; there will be a great battle this time."" ""How far is it to Iwis?"" said Felix. ""Twenty-seven miles,"" replied the dame; ""and if you take my advice, you had better walk twenty-seven miles there, than two miles back to the bridge over the river."" Someone now called from the opposite bank, and she started with the boat to fetch another passenger. ""Thank you, very much,"" said Felix, as he wished her good day; ""but why did not the man at the other ferry tell me I could cross here?"" [SNIPPET] A dove was cooing in the forest not far distant, but as he was about to resume work the cooing ceased. Then a wood-pigeon rose from the ashes with a loud clapping of wings. Felix listened. His hunter instinct told him that something was moving there. A rustling of the bushes followed, and he took his spear which had been leant against the adjacent tree. But, peering into the wood, in a moment he recognised Oliver, who, having walked off his rage, was returning. ""I though it might have been a Bushman,"" said Felix, replacing his spear; ""only they are noiseless."" ""Any of them might have cut me down,"" said Oliver; ""for I forgot my weapon."
1680,"When they had arrived, he caused mass to be celebrated in apartment; and just as the priest was elevating the host, Montaigne fell forward with his arms extended in front of him, on the bed, and so expired. He was in his sixtieth year. It was the 13th September 1592.  Montaigne was buried near his own house; but a few years after his decease, his remains were removed to the church of a Commandery of St. Antoine at Bordeaux, where they still continue. His monument was restored in 1803 by a descendant. It was seen about 1858 by an English traveller (Mr. St. John).’—[“Montaigne the Essayist,” by Bayle St. John, 1858, 2 vols. 8vo, is one of most delightful books of the kind.]— and was then in good preservation.  In 1595 Mademoiselle de Gournay published a new edition of Montaigne’s Essays, and the first with the latest emendations of the author, from a copy presented to her by his widow, and which has not been recovered, although it is known to have been in existence some years after the date of the impression, made on its authority. [SNIPPET] Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, “It is my belief, Sancho, that this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am persuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.”  “If your worship knew that,” returned Sancho—“woe betide me and all my kindred!—why did you let me taste it?”  At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for nothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and convulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end had come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he had the security and confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on his squire’s beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass; after which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn he laid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance. All that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood watching him; the innkeeper’s daughter was likewise observing him, and he too never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched a sigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they all thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate they who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.  As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to the host and said in a very grave and measured voice, “Many and great are the favours, Señor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of yours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you of any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is no other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to chastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of knighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the utmost of your desire.”"
1681,"Why have ye left your bowers desolate, Your lutes, and gentler fate? ' We follow Bacchus, Bacchus on the wing A-conquering! Bacchus, young Bacchus! Good or ill betide We dance before him thorough kingdoms wide! Come hither, Lady fair, and joined be To our wild minstrelsy!'"" [SNIPPET] ""It was your touching me,"" she muttered, resuming her gazing into the grate. He stood looking anxiously down on her. It would have been better not to discuss her state, and he knew it; but in his anxiety he forgot it. ""That jumpiness is the effect of your illness, you know. I shall be glad when it's all over. It's made you so odd."" She was not pleased that he should speak of her ""oddness."""
1682,"I'll stay here till I get hungry and then join you."" Mjly unflexed her sense of touch and I felt sorry for her. "" If I could be sure,"" I said, ""that no wild animals live on the earth, I'd go sooner."" She snapped her sense of balance in happiness. "" I will go first,"" said she. "" If everything is pleasant and safe, I will return and let you know."" [SNIPPET] ""Well, I could only see it, of course, Dr. Al. But as far as I saw it, it was exactly what we'd ... no, wait!"" Perrie frowned, wrinkling her nose. "" There was something added!"" She giggled. "" At least, I don't remember anyone saying we should imagine the sandwich wrapped in a paper napkin!"" Across the room, a woman's voice said breathlessly, ""Oh!"
1683,"Fighting disappointment—failure. Yes. That was the kind of fight it had been. How many failures? The first big one had come six years before. [SNIPPET] I've been here before. Wallabies and wombats!"" ""Very good, Frances."" Frances smirked at the approbation. "" I've been to the zoo lots of times,"" she said to the girl next to her. "" My father takes me."""
1684,"That's why I can't tell anyone what happened. No one would believe that Gremm would be dishonest. And I can't prove it, because she ate the proof. Even if I did tell them, no one is going to believe that a fly-catcher plant—even a big one like mine—would actually be able to eat a man. [SNIPPET] Of course, no one wanted to bother carrying it around. It was too heavy. The only ones who ever used it, anyway, were members of the council. As the man said, we haven't had a dishonest person in the State for thousands of years. Even I know that much."
1685,"I just finished it. It had some pretty good stories in it."" ""No, thanks, the wrong side always wins in that one."" ""The wrong ... oh, I forgot. I guess they don't write stories where your side wins."" ""It's not really a question of 'my side'. My tribe gave up the practice of tribal life and tribal customs over fifty years ago. I had the same education in a public school as any other American child. I read the same newspapers and watch the same TV shows as anyone else. [SNIPPET] Cold and withdrawn, almost unfamiliar. ""What do you want?"" B'prith came toward him, claws behind his back in the formal Pas-udeti posture, used between total strangers. "" You shouldn't have come here, today."" ""I know,"" Tony said. B'prith got out a bit of tis stalk and began to roll it into a tube. He pretended to concentrate on it. "" Look,"" he said. "" You said you have a right here."
1686,"Where the hell's the girdle?"" ""They took it off,"" Paula said tearfully. "" Oh, Andy, they took it off. You don't need it any more. You're healed, completely healed. [SNIPPET] ""Dummel dich, Stoltz,"" Martha said. "" I've got to make your supper yet, and we don't have so much as a stove lit in our tent."" Stoltzfoos slapped the team back into motion. "" What we need for our journey home are a few of the altie lieder,"" he said, reaching back in the wagon for his scarred guitar. He strummed and hummed, then began singing in his clear baritone: ""In da guut alt Suumer-zeit . ""... In da guut alt Suumer-zeit,"" Martha's voice joined him. As they jolted along the path through the pine trees, heading toward Datura-village, near which their homestead stood, they sang the other homey songs to the music of the old guitar. "" Drawk Mich Zrick zu Alt Virginye,"" nostalgic for the black-garbed Plain-Folk left at home."
1687,"I shouted hoarsely, reeling back towards the palace, ""Heru, 'tis well; the worst is past!""  But the little princess was unconscious, and at her feet was poor Si, quite dead, still reclining with her head in her hands just as I had left her. Then my own senses gave out, and dropping down by them I remembered no more.  I must have lain there an hour or two, for when consciousness came again it was night—black, cool, profound night, with an inky sky low down upon the tree-tops, and out of it such a glorious deluge of rain descending swiftly and silently as filled my veins even to listen to. Eagerly I shuffled away to the porch steps, down them into the swimming courtyard, and ankle-deep in the glorious flood, set to work lapping furiously at the first puddle, drinking with gasps of pleasure, gasping and drinking again, feeling my body filling out like the thirsty steaming earth below me. Then, as I still drank insatiably, there came a gleam of lightning out of the gloom overhead, a brilliant yellow blaze, and by it I saw a few yards away a panther drinking at the same pool as myself, his gleaming eyes low down like mine upon the water, and by his side two apes, the black water running in at their gaping mouths, while out beyond were more pools, more drinking animals. Everything was drinking. [SNIPPET] ""That must have been in dreams.""  ""What is all that talking about?"" growled a sleepy voice of authority from the stern.  ""Bow man, sir, says he can see a boat.""  ""And what does it matter if he can?"
1688,"We had a good season. The Io was filled up steady from June to the end of August and a couple of times we had to give a ship the No Vacancy signal on the radar. Toward the end of the season, Frank Nineteen checked in again but Min and I were too busy catering to a party of VIPs to do anything about it. "" We'll wait till he gets back from the asteroids,"" I said. "" Suppose one of these big wheels found out about him and Elizabeth. [SNIPPET] He was sure that there must be a back entrance to the king's chambers, and he found the little door he was looking for. From there on was darkness. He felt his way, stepping with infinite caution, and presently there was a faint gleam of light filtering around the edges of another curtain of heavy tapestry. He crept toward it, and heard a man's slow breathing on the other side. He drew the curtain back, a careful inch. The man was sprawled on a bench athwart the door. He slept the honest sleep of exhaustion, his sword in his hand, the stains of his day's work still upon him. He was alone in the small room. A door in the farther wall was closed."
1689,"""[161] After what seemed like a long time, however, a twinkle of lights showed over the East Konk Mountains. They weren't the flashes of explosions; some were magnesium flares, and some were the lights of a ship. ""That's Procyon, from Grank,"" he said. "" [SNIPPET] In some way that guard would maneuver matters so the encounter could come about. Besides, he would endeavor to keep Luke in his squad where he would be able to drive him to the utmost. The guards, Novak had said, were on the job only a month when they were replaced by fresh recruits—and their pay was based on the productivity of the squads they commanded. Kulan had seen that the Earthman was a real sapper; worth three of the others. And he'd try to keep it so.  That working period was a highly gratifying one to Luke. With the rankling hatred concentrated and directed at Kulan, he was positively gleeful. And yet he was content to bide his time. He swung his pick and wielded his rock drill with joyful abandon, so that three men were kept busy loading the ore he removed."
1690,"Near it, chipped at all the corners, was a miniature given him by Emma: her toilette seemed to him pretentious, and her languishing look in the worst possible taste. Then, from looking at this image and recalling the memory of its original, Emma's features little by little grew confused in his remembrance, as [252] if the living and the painted face, rubbing one against the other, had effaced each other. Finally, he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations relating to their journey, short, technical, and urgent, like business notes. He wanted to see the long ones again, those of old times. In order to find them at the bottom of the box, Rodolphe disturbed all the others, and mechanically began rummaging amidst this mass of papers and things, finding pell-mell bouquets, garters, a black mask, pins, and hair—hair! dark and fair, some even, catching in the hinges of the box, broke when it was opened. Thus dallying with his souvenirs, he examined the writing and the style of the letters, as varied as their orthography. They were tender or jovial, facetious, melancholy; there were some that asked for love, others that asked for money. A word recalled faces to him, certain gestures, the sound of a voice; sometimes, however, he remembered nothing at all. [SNIPPET] Monsieur Bovary, one of our most distinguished practitioners, performed an operation on a club-footed man called Hippolyte Tautain, stable-man for the last twenty-five years at the hotel of the ""Lion d'Or,"" kept by Widow Lefrançois, at the Place d'Armes. The novelty of the attempt, and the interest incident to the subject, had attracted such a concourse of persons that there was a veritable obstruction on the threshold of the establishment. The operation, moreover, was performed as if by magic, and barely a few drops of blood appeared on the skin, as if to show that the rebellious tendon had at last given way beneath the efforts of art. The patient, strangely enough—we affirm it as an eye-witness—complained of no pain. His condition up to the present time leaves nothing to be desired. Everything tends to show that his convalescence will be brief; and who knows whether, at our next village festivity, we shall not see our good Hippolyte figuring in the bacchic dance in the midst of a chorus of joyous boon-companions, and thus proving to all eyes by his verve and his capers his complete cure? Honor, then, to the generous savants! Honor to those indefatigable spirits who consecrate their vigils to the amelioration or to the alleviation of their kind!"
1691,"In normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public, and they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal trials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge here and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially difficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very simple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with their laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human relationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this. That's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behind them carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret. You could have seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom you would least expect it, staring out this window in despair on the street below while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he can give them good advice. And at times like that it's also possible to see how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions and how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it's just not in their natures to overcome. But they're not in an easy position, to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice. The different ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless, and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what's going to happen. But even for the junior officials, the proceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are hardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed, court affairs appear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on further without their learning where they go. [SNIPPET] Any intelligence they have is the property of the whole community—like an ant-heap. That's it! Ants are willing to die for their ant-hill; so are these creatures."" ""So are men,"" observed the captain, ""if it comes to that."" ""Yes, but men aren't exactly eager. It takes some emotion like patriotism to work 'em to the point of dying for their country; these things do it all in the day's work."" He paused."
1692,"My master told him. The other shook his head slowly, and began to feel me over.  “I can't say who eats your corn, my dear fellow, but I am much mistaken if your horse gets it. Have you ridden very fast?” [SNIPPET] Proceed, please—accost the head of the house."" The king unconsciously straightened up like a monument, and said, with frozen austerity: ""Varlet, bring a seat; and serve to me what cheer ye have."" ""Ah, your grace, that is not well done."""
1693,"I'm keepin' you in my squad, tough guy.""  A ripple of astonished comment ran along the line and the other guards bellowed for silence. Kulan fingered the black tube of his neutro-beam and his broad face was chalky white.  Luke advanced two paces, still grinning. And he looked up sneeringly into the grim face that was a foot above his own.  ""That's right, you big ape,"" he grated, ""you ain't man enough to fight the way men fight. Gotta use dart guns, or gravity.""  It was sheer baiting of the big Martian. [SNIPPET] Ulana moaned, pale and distraught. "" All—all are gone?""  ""All, my dear. In his rage the Dictator destroyed the Tritu Deanu and the Tritu Raortu when he had finished here. Those were the last settlements remaining, you know. We alone are left behind, Ulana."""
1694,"I had hoped that the main culprit would try to save unwitting accomplices from a measure of grief. That is all."" The seven students left Dr. Clayton's office in record time. Professor Elton rapped the table for silence. "" Gentlemen,"" he began, ""Dr. Clayton and I both extend our sincere apologies."" He smiled wanly. "" Of course, that does not exonerate anyone from the charge of gullibility. But Harvey Gale's confession has been fully confirmed by the FBI, and you—and this University—have been cleared. [SNIPPET] It's healthy, like."" Klett frowned. "" If I thought there was a gram of talent involved in your capture of the Mayor, Lane, I'd never release you from duty. But I know better. You beat that analogue computer by sheer stupidity—by disregarding your cybrain."" Lane said, ""It wasn't so stupid if it worked."" ""That's what bothers me."
1695,"——My father thrust back his chair——rose up—put on his hat——took four long strides to the door——jerked it open——thrust his head half way out——shut the door again——took no notice of the bad hinge—returned to the table—pluck’d my mother’s thread-paper out of Slawkenbergius’s book——went hastily to his bureau—walked slowly back—twisted my mother’s thread-paper about his thumb—unbutton’d his waistcoat—threw my mother’s thread-paper into the fire——bit her sattin pin-cushion in two, fill’d his mouth with bran—confounded it;—but mark!—the oath of confusion was levell’d at my uncle Toby’s brain—which was e’en confused enough already——the curse came charged only with the bran—the bran, may it please your honours, was no more than powder to the ball. ’Twas well my father’s passions lasted not long; for so long as they did last, they led him a busy life on’t; and it is one of the most unaccountable problems that ever I met with in my observations of human nature, that nothing should prove my father’s mettle so much, or make his passions go off so like gun-powder, as the unexpected strokes his science met with from the quaint simplicity of my uncle Toby’s questions.——Had ten dozen of hornets stung him behind in so many different places all at one time—he could not have exerted more mechanical functions in fewer seconds——or started half so much, as with one single quære of three words unseasonably popping in full upon him in his hobby-horsical career. ’Twas all one to my uncle Toby——he smoked his pipe on with unvaried composure——his heart never intended offence to his brother—and as his head could seldom find out where the sting of it lay——he always gave my father the credit of cooling by himself.——He was five minutes and thirty-five seconds about it in the present case. By all that’s good! said my father, swearing, as he came to himself, and taking the oath out of Ernulphus’s digest of curses——(though to do my father justice it was a fault (as he told Dr. Slop in the affair of Ernulphus) which he as seldom committed as any man upon earth)——By all that’s good and great! brother Toby, said my father, if it was not for the aids of philosophy, which befriend one so much as they do—you would put a man beside all temper.——Why, by the solutions of noses, of which I was telling you, I meant, as you might have known, had you favoured me with one grain of attention, the various accounts which learned men of different kinds of knowledge have given the world of the causes of short and long noses.——There is no cause but one, replied my uncle Toby——why one man’s nose is longer than another’s, but because that God pleases to have it so.——That is Grangousier’s solution, said my father.—’Tis he, continued my uncle Toby, looking up, and not regarding my father’s interruption, who makes us all, and frames and puts us together in such forms and proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable to his infinite wisdom,.——’Tis a pious account, cried my father, but not philosophical—there is more religion in it than sound science. ’ Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle Toby’s character——that he feared God, and reverenced religion.——So the moment my father finished his remark——my uncle Toby fell a whistling Lillabullero with more zeal (though more out of tune) than usual.— What is become of my wife’s thread-paper? NO matter—as an appendage to seamstressy, the thread-paper might be of some consequence to my mother—of none to my father, as a mark in Slawkenbergius. [SNIPPET] The person to whom they applied was a Spanish sea-captain, who offered to agree with them upon reasonable terms. He appointed to meet them at a public-house, whither Candide and the faithful Cacambo[Pg 92] went with their two sheep, and awaited his coming. Candide, who had his heart upon his lips, told the Spaniard all his adventures, and avowed that he intended to elope with Miss Cunegonde. ""Then I will take good care not to carry you to Buenos Ayres,"" said the seaman. "" I should be hanged, and so would you. The fair Cunegonde is my lord's favourite mistress."" This was a thunderclap for Candide: he wept for a long while. At last he drew Cacambo aside."
1696,"Five hundred miles out from New York the Aurania was joined by the Oceana, the largest vessel on the Canadian Pacific [Pg 172] line from Halifax to Liverpool. So far no enemy had been seen. The two great liners reached the first battleship together, and were joined by the second pair of cruisers. Before sunset the Cunarder had drawn ahead of her companions, and by nightfall was racing away alone over the water with every light carefully concealed, and keeping an eager look-out for friend or foe. [SNIPPET] Whines like a steel top. Fifty kilowatts sure, and maybe more! And a twelve-thousand-metre wave."" ""I do not fully understand,"" interjected Rostoloff. "" Please explain, sir."" ""Ain't nothin' to explain,"" returned Hood. """
1697,"“We'll leave Earth by centrifugal force, for I can make much better speed in the atmosphere where there is plenty of power to draw on; outside I must depend solely on sunlight. We'll circle the Earth, forming an orbit just within the atmosphere, at five miles a second. We'll gradually increase the speed to about ten miles a second, at which point the ship would normally fly off into space under its own centrifugal force. With the power units we'll prevent its release until the proper moment. [SNIPPET] Once the clerks understood what I had in mind they hurled themselves into their work, urged on by the fires of patriotism and the burning voices of their superiors. All I had to do was suggest a line of search and the relevant documents would begin appearing at once. Bit by bit a pattern started to emerge. A delicate webwork of forgery, bribery, chicanery and falsehood. It could only have been conceived by a mind as brilliantly crooked as my own. I chewed my lip with jealousy. Like all great ideas, this one was basically simple. A party or parties unknown had neatly warped the ship construction program to their own ends. Undoubtedly they had started the program for the giant transport, that would have to be checked later."
1698,"He no longer dared let go. Another tickle developed beside the first. He scrubbed his face against the coarse fibre of the rope; the relief was like a world conquered. Then they glided in a steady spiral that carried them upward with scarcely a feather's motion. When the next plunge came Johnny was ready for it and leaned back until the hippogriff arched its neck, trying to free itself from the pressure on its windpipe. Half choked, it glided again, and Johnny gave it breath. They landed on one of the little islands. The hippogriff drooped its head and wings, trembling. [SNIPPET] I'm holding it. Release it, you hear?"" Davies fumbled for the broad belt around his thickening middle. He jabbed the button that sent a negative current through the cable."
1699,"Where would you have me go?""  ""My eyes were fixed upon her countenance while she spoke. I thought upon her virtues; I viewed her as the mother of my babes: as my wife: I recalled the purpose for which I thus urged her attendance. My heart faltered, and I saw that I must rouse to this work all my faculties. The danger of the least delay was imminent.  ""I looked away from her, and again exerting my force, drew her towards the door—'You must go with me—indeed you must.'  ""In her fright she half-resisted my efforts, and again exclaimed, 'Good heaven! what is it you mean? [SNIPPET] And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, ""There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with—'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'—and I shall keep mine to swell my song."" Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display. Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached."
1700,"John Drinkard slapped his hand against the boulder beside him and seemed reassured by its solidity. He shook his head to clear it. ""I don't get it,"" he objected. "" Chuck and I could call ourselves explorers, too, if rambling around the mountains every chance we get falls under that heading."" ""We do not explore the mountains,"" said Dzell. "" Here we rest and allow ourselves to behave normally. We explore in the towns and in the cities, where people gather. [SNIPPET] Then you were chin-up."" ""That was different,"" said Evers. "" I wasn't hurting."" When the stars were out and the quarter moon rose from the plains, John Drinkard got up from his bedroll seat by the fire. The two men had sat talking quietly for an hour."
1701,"Before him he could hear the occasional low moans of the banth, and presently from behind came a similar uncanny note. Another banth had entered the passageway on his trail!  His position was anything but pleasant. His eyes could not penetrate the darkness even to the distinguishing of his hand before his face, while the banths, he knew, could see quite well, though absence of light were utter.  No other sounds came to his ears than the dismal, bloodthirsty moanings of the beast ahead and the beast behind. [SNIPPET] By way of reply, the little lady, light as an elf, took me by the fingertips, and, gleefully skipping forward, piloted me through the mazes of her city until we came out into the great square fronting on the palace, which rose beyond it like a white chalk cliff in the dull light. Not a taper showed anywhere round its circumference, but a mysterious kind of radiance like sea phosphorescence beamed from the palace porch. All was in such deathlike silence that the nails in my ""ammunition"" boots made an unpleasant clanking as they struck on the marble pavement; yet, by the uncertain starlight, I saw, to my surprise, the whole square was thronged with Martians, all facing towards the porch, as still, graven images, and as voiceless, for once, as though they had indeed been marble. It was strange to see them sitting there in the twilight, waiting for I knew not what, and my friend's voice at my elbow almost startled me as she said, in a whisper, ""The princess knows you are in the crowd, and desires you to go up upon the steps near where she will be.""  ""Who brought her message?"""

Do you suppose Koltan would agree to produce a new type of stove when the old has sold well for centuries? Besides, why do you need a whole new stove for one little pot?"" ""A dozen pots.

1703,"Perhaps it isn't fair to give the impression that the desk was in disorder. It was merely busy; just as though someone who had been deeply engaged in working had for the moment stepped away. There was a row of books across the back edge, and Tony leaned over eagerly to glance at the titles. ""'Theory of Parallels,' Lobatchevsky; 'Transformation of Complex Functions,' Riemann; 'Tensors and Geodesics,' Gauss,"" Tony read. "" Hm—old stuff. [SNIPPET] Chicago destroyed by fire.

1705,"It was true that the few hundreds of people huddled together there had the dress and looks of moderns; it was true, also, that the gloom was lighted for them by electric bulbs, and that electric radiators kept them warm; yet Dante himself, in painting the ninth circle of his Inferno, could not have imagined a drearier and more despondent group than these that slouched and drooped and muttered in that cavernous recess, seated with their heads fallen low upon their knees, or moodily pacing back and forth like captives who can hope for no escape. "" Here at least we will be safe from the sky marauders,"" I heard one of them muttering. Yet I could not help wondering what the mere safety of the body could mean when all the glories of man's civilization were annihilated. There came a whirring in my head, and another blank interval; and when I regained my senses I knew that another period of time had passed, possibly months or even years. I stood on the palisade above the river, near the entrance of the caves; and the sun was bright above me; but there was no brightness in the men and women that trailed out of a small circular hole in the ground. Drab as dock-rats, and pasty pale of countenance as hospital inmates, and with bent backs and dirty, tattered clothes and a mouse-like nosing manner, they emerged with the wariness of hunted refugees; and they flung up their hands with low cries to shield them from the brilliance of the sun, to which they were evidently unaccustomed. From the packs on their backs and the bundles in their hands, I knew that they were emerging from their subterranean refuge, to try to begin a new life in the ravaged world above; and my heart went out to them, for I saw that, few as they were—not more than fifty in all—they were the sole survivors of a once-populous region, and would have a bitter fight to wage in the man-made wilderness that had been a world metropolis. But as they roamed above through the waste of ash and rubble, and as they wandered abroad where the fields had been and saw how every brush and tree had been seared from the earth or poisoned by chemical brews, I knew that their fight was not merely a bitter one—it was hopeless. And I heard them muttering among themselves, ""We have not even any tools!"", [SNIPPET] It took time to achieve the right shade of purple in the bathroom plastic-dispenser, but no time at all to pour, solidify, and cut the sheet-like robe required for the occasion.

Kate, his slender wife, who had been up and at work for an hour, looked moth-eaten by comparison, as if their nest had been lined with her plucked-out down.

1706,"Three Barbarians from Terra!"" Down on the dark street, they met their mercenary again. He eyed them sourly. "" I see you were, in a sense, successful."" Peter Hawley faced the mercenary. "" We were successful and would you like to make something of it?"" [SNIPPET] Mrs. Bagley took a sandwich and a glass of milk to James and found him sitting on a chair, a heavy headset covering most of his skull, reading aloud from a textbook on electronic theory. Mrs. Bagley stopped at the door, unaccountably startled. James looked up and shut off his work. "" It's finished,"" he said with grave pride."
1707,"""That wasn't you. You didn't have guts enough to rent a super mech and go back to your old job."" The woman laughed. "" Janith tried to insult and needle you into being a man again. [SNIPPET] The coloring was ugly and the proportions out of line. And it was not canvas but curling sheets of paper taped and painted to resemble frames! A big man, sandy-haired and with vertical wrinkles deep between piercing blue eyes, came into the room. She shrank into the bed, seeing that the sheet she tugged taut across her breast was ragged and blue. ""Ruth,"" he said, a slow smile making his face almost handsome, ""you're better."

1709,"And you’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least partly right!”  But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.  Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. [SNIPPET] We now have further evidence both of the extreme antiquity of the literary form of the Gilgamesh Epic and also of the disposition to make the Epic the medium of illustrating aspects of life and the destiny of mankind. The discovery by Dr. Arno Poebel of a Sumerian form of the tale of the descent of Ishtar to the lower world and her release11—apparently a nature myth to illustrate the change of season from summer to winter and back again to spring—enables us to pass beyond the Akkadian (or Semitic) form of tales current in the Euphrates Valley to the Sumerian form. Furthermore, we are indebted to Dr. Langdon for the identification of two Sumerian fragments in the Nippur Collection which deal with the adventures of Gilgamesh, one in Constantinople,12 the other in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.13 The former, of which only 25 lines are preserved (19 on the obverse and 6 on the reverse), appears to be a description of the weapons of Gilgamesh with which he arms himself for an encounter—presumably the encounter with Ḫumbaba or Ḫuwawa, the ruler of the cedar forest in the mountain.14 The latter deals with the building operations of Gilgamesh in the city of Erech.

[SNIPPET] I've the nicest tub—pink, deep—and nine kinds of bath salts. But I wish you weren't so tired, love, because it's a long flight and you're wearing me out."" He was silent as he bent to the correct compass heading and cranked a handle over his head to adjust the trim. "" Koitska's going to be so huhu,"" he said, smiling. "" Never fear, love, I can calm him down. But it's easier to do with you in one piece, you know, the other way's too late."" He was silent for a long time, and then his voice began to sing. They were songs from Rosalie's own musical comedies. Even with so poor an instrument as Chandler's voice to work with, she sang well enough to keep both of them entertained while his body brought the plane in for a landing; and so Chandler went to live in the villa that belonged to Rosalie Pan."
1711,"A great burst of roseate flame leaped toward Powell from the projector. The laboratory was instantly blotted out in a swirling chaos of ruddy radiance that swept him up and away like a chip upon a tidal wave. There was a long moment during which he seemed to hurtle helplessly through a universe of swirling tinted mists, while great electric waves tingled with exquisite poignancy through every atom of his body. Then the mists suddenly cleared like the tearing away of a mighty curtain, and with startling abruptness Powell found himself again in a solid world of material things. For a moment as he gazed dazedly about him he thought that the roseate glow of the projector must still be playing tricks with his eyesight, for the landscape around him was completely and incredibly red! He soon realized that the monochrome of scarlet was a natural aspect of things in Arret. [SNIPPET] ""What time is it?"" ""Half past one. Great Scott! So that's why you spun that yarn."" Baron hoisted his six feet one out of the easy chair. "" It's way past your bedtime. Didn't mean to keep you up."""
1712,"By the time he was ready, the helicopter was waiting. He and Haruhiku entered, and the crewman at the controls took off for the scene of the dispute. Arriving over the village, they hovered a few minutes while Haruhiku studied the lay of the land. The lieutenant had been to this world before, long enough to pick up some of the language and customs, so Mayne was content to follow his advice about landing a little way off from a spaceship that towered outside the village. They came down about a hundred yards away, between a rutted sort of road and a long hut covered by a curved, thatched roof. [SNIPPET] ""Nice kid, nice kid, nice kid,"" McLean said. ""You're too eager."" The blush on her cheeks was visible through the sand. Hastily she applied her eye to the sight of the Rangeley. McLean sighed."
1713,"The report originated from the following circumstance: Mr. Percy Bysshe Shelly, a gentleman well known for extravagance of doctrine, and for his daring, in their profession, even to sign himself with the title of ATHeos in the Album at Chamouny, having taken a house below, in which he resided with Miss M. W. Godwin and Miss Clermont, (the daughters of the celebrated Mr. Godwin) they were frequently visitors at Diodati, and were often seen upon the lake with his Lordship, which gave rise to the report, the truth of which is here positively denied.  Among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord B., Mr. P. B. Shelly, the two ladies and the gentleman before alluded to, after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana, began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelly's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantle-piece, with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. [SNIPPET] He spoke with outstretched hand and winning voice, and then turning to our invaders, with a severe brow, he commanded them to lay down their arms: “Do you think,” he said, “that because we are wasted by plague, you can overcome us; the plague is also among you, and when ye are vanquished by famine and disease, the ghosts of those you have murdered will arise to bid you not hope in death. Lay down your arms, barbarous and cruel men—men whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent, whose souls are weighed down by the orphan’s cry! We shall conquer, for the right is on our side; already your cheeks are pale—the weapons fall from your nerveless grasp. Lay down your arms, fellow men! brethren!"
1714,"""Tchall!"" Chmidd hissed at him. "" We cannot speak to Lords-Master.[Pg 74] We must speak to their chief-slaves."" ""But they have no slaves,"" Hozhet objected. "" Didn't you hear the ... the one with the small beard ... say so?"" [SNIPPET] ""The peoples of the world,"" he said softly, ""are concerned with these things in the abstract, but mostly, we the people are willing to leave this to the theorists, while we rejoice."" ""For we the people, who thought we faced that most degrading, that most unanswerable, that most horrible fate of all, bacteriological war, find ourselves at bacteriological peace."" At the break, the thirteen witches danced on, crying their chant, and behind them as a background was the bright, clean sub-and-shanty scene. ""Witches of the world unite, to make it clean, clean, clean, Witch clean—NOW!"" they chanted. "" Pestilence or peril, disease or disaster, Stay clean, clean, clean, Witch clean!"" ""Ah,"" said the deep voice of the announcer as the jingle muted, ""Which witch do you really wish?"
1715,"Everybody knows that, but nobody can prove it. Except the PRS. And the PRS is busy doing just what it can about that proof. And all it takes is a few of you. I don’t know how many—I don’t know how many of you there really are, for that matter. But it must be a fair number to stock all your branches with “top-level” executives and the lower-level men and women who really believe in the PRS blind, and do their best to keep it working. [SNIPPET] When we tabbed up the Io's receipts that year they were so good Min and I decided to take a month off for an Earthside vacation. Min's retired brother in Berkeley was nice enough to come out and look after the place for us while we spent four solid weeks soaking up the sun in Southern California. When we got back out to the spotel, though, I could see there was something wrong by the look on Jim's face. ""It's that girl robot of yours, Bill,"" he said. "" She's gone and deactivated herself."" We went right to 22A and found Elizabeth Seven stretched out on the floor. There was a screwdriver clutched in her hand and the relay banks in her side were exposed and horribly blackened. ""Crazy mech shorted out her own DX,"" Jim said."
1716,"The woman rocked in her chair, her mouth quivering. "" They'll get somebody."" The farmer shook his head. "" Too many people doing other things, like making shells and guns, like sitting in fox-holes or flying planes."" The woman sat rocking, her hands together in her lap. "" It won't work,"" she repeated. ""It'll work,"" said the farmer. "" Right now, it'll work. [SNIPPET] He sent the car gliding slowly ... no more traffic rules ... down Fifth Avenue. The buildings here also were well-built; they were many centuries old and would probably last as many more. The shop windows were empty, except for tangles of dust ... an occasional broken, discarded mannequin.... In some instances the glass had already cracked or fallen out. Since there were no children to throw stones, however, others might last indefinitely, carefully glassing in nothingness. Doors stood open and he could see rows of empty counters and barren shelves fuzzed high with the dust of the years since a customer had approached them."
1717,"She smiled. "" Come into the dining room."" The three-dimensional picture had been rolled up into the corner. Henry promised to put it away in the cellar and clean up the cellar as soon as he could. [SNIPPET] That, he decided, was what he would do. That would leave his body reasonably free, and at the same time impress them with the fact that he was different from them. By manipulating the air valve he would be able to make the viewplates cloud and uncloud at will, thus giving dramatic expression to his feelings. It would be a pleasant game to play until he had learned something of their language."
1718,"I speak, gentlemen, of Texas, 1957!"" ""What if the Texans object?"" ""They have no choice. The Time Door is strictly a one-way passage. I saw to that. It will be utterly impossible for anyone in 1957 to re-enter our world of 2057. And now—the Past awaits!"" He tossed aside his professorial robes. [SNIPPET] Let us try something else,"" he said. "" Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind has been theorized, though we have met with no examples—"" ""Neither have we,"" Korvin said. "" We are all individuals, like yourselves."" ""But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions—"" ""We have no need of one,"" Korvin said calmly."
1719,"So the Lady Jeanne met Sir Launcelot. And once again the tale of her plight was revealed. And even as Sir Launcelot listened, the plan of what to do came to Sir Galahad. But he kept his tongue until his friend was fully informed and had in turn had time to question their hostess. Charles stood close to his master, whose arm encircled him as if it would include him in all of it. A little in the background stood the two squires who were close friends and old comrades. [SNIPPET] I re-examined the guinea-pig, and observed it carefully. I need not detail my studies. But in the end I found that my 'mistake' had in reality been a momentous discovery. I found that I had only to close certain organs, to re-arrange certain ducts, and to open certain dormant organs, and, mirabile dictu, the whole process of reproduction was changed. ""You have heard, of course, that our bodies are continually changing, hour by hour, minute by minute, so that every few years we have been literally reborn. Some such principle as this seems to operate in reproduction, except that, instead of the old body being replaced by the new, and in its form, approximately, the new body is created apart from it."
1720,"Then they slugged me and put me in a hole."" His eyes questioned. She felt their demand and said, ""I was—asleep in my hotel room."" ""They overlooked you?"" ""I guess so."" ""Then you don't know anything about it?"" ""Nothing. [SNIPPET] Naked in the window, but it didn't matter, because it gave onto an airshaft and other windows so caked with grime as to be of no value as windows. But even aside from that, it didn't matter. It didn't matter in the least. She went to the washstand, her bare feet making no sound on the worn rug. She turned on the faucets, but no water came. No water, and she had a terrible thirst."
1721,"He remained there gazing up at the sky long after it had vanished. He was heard to murmur, ""I am glad the kid could go, but it is just a lark to him. He never had a 'sense of wonder.' How could he—nobody reads anymore."" Afterward, his senile emotions betraying him, he broke down completely and had to be led from the field. It is rumored he did not live long after that. The Goddard drove on until Mars filled the viz-screen. It was planned to make at least a half-dozen braking passes around the planet for observational purposes before the actual business of bringing the ship in for landfall began. As expected the atmosphere proved to be thin. [SNIPPET] Something's come up—it may be a very nasty business—and I'd like to talk to you about it."" ""Well, Chief, let me remind you that this vacation, which I've had to postpone four times already, has been overdue for four years,"" Vall said. ""Yes, Vall, I know. You've been working very hard, and you and Dalla are entitled to a little time together."
1722,"""Gentlemen,"" said Parr at last, ""before I accept command or other office, give me information. Just now you were acting violently. You, Sadau, started explaining. Go ahead."" Sadau shrugged a lean freckled shoulder, and with a jerk of his head directed his companions to retire toward the huts. They obeyed, with one or two backward glances. Left alone with Parr, Sadau looked up with a wise, friendly expression. [SNIPPET] We shall remain lovers, but we shall forget mere carnal desire. I shall submit to that operation too!"" And I could not shake her from her resolve. I would speak of danger that I could not let her face. But, after the fashion of women, she disarmed me with the accusation that I did not love her, that I did not want her love, that I was trying to escape from love."
1723,"Next time nothing will come through except light, and only as much of that as you feel like admitting. You can wait as close to a vortex as you please, for as long as you please; until you get exactly the activity and time-interval that you want. You will be just as comfortable and just as safe as though you were home in bed."" ""Sure of that?"" ""Absolutely—or at least, as sure as we can be of anything that hasn't happened yet. [SNIPPET] It was full dark when Konkrook came in view beyond the East Konk Mountains, a lurid smear on the underside of the clouds, and at Gongonk Island and at the Company farms to the south, a couple of bunches of searchlights were fingering about in the sky. When von Schlichten turned on the outside sound-pickup, he could hear the distant tom-tomming of heavy guns, and the crash of shells and bombs. Keeping the car high enough to be above the trajectories of incoming shells, Harry Quong circled over the city while Hassan Bogdanoff talked to Gongonk Inland on the radio. The city was in a bad way. There were seventy-five to a hundred big fires going, and a new one started in a rising ball of thermoconcentrate flame while they watched. The three gun-cutters, Elmoran, Gaucho and Bushranger, and about fifty big freight lorries converted to bombers, were shuttling back and forth between the island and the city. The Royal Palace was on fire from end to end, and the entire waterfront and industrial district were in flames. Combat-cars and air jeeps were diving in to shell and rocket and machine-gun streets and buildings. He saw six big bomber-lorries move in dignified procession to unload, one after the other, on a row of buildings along what the Terrans called South Tenth Street, and on the roofs of buildings a block away, red and blue flares were burning, and he could see figures, both human and Ullran, setting up mortars and machine-guns."
1724,"Chinese dragon dances? Hell, why not? The idea of space travelers visiting earth to learn a new dance was no more fantastic than the idea of them being here at all. Wayne turned his face to the door and shouted, ""Hey, is that it? A dance? You want us to teach you a dance called the high dragon bump?"" A muffled metallic voice from the other side said, ""Nod danz. Bump. Huguff quig."" [SNIPPET] Immediately I began thinking of the things I should have done, the machinery I should have set in motion instead of the one thing I had done. By all means, I ought to have notified the police directly. My notion that telenosis influenced all the police desk sergeants in town was hysterical, baseless. Well, I could call back, even now— But I couldn't. The car was moving at a relatively slow speed—but still over fifty miles an hour, on a narrow unpaved, downgrade road. Through the side window I saw dark trees and shadowy brush gliding by. And then through the window I saw lighted storefronts, mail boxes, a few vague pedestrians on smooth sidewalks, and two dogs running tirelessly beside the car, barking as they ran. Repeated pounding on the heavy black box did not restore reality."
1725,"I shook my head, but I could not help thinking what an ironic thing it would have been if there had been something to McIlvaine's story, and in the process to which he had been subjected from out of space he had not been rejuvenated so much as just sent back in time, in which case he would have no memory of the machine nor of the use to which it had been put. It would have been as ironic for the inhabitants of McIlvaine's star, too; they would doubtless have looked forward to keeping this contact with Earth open and failed to realize that McIlvaine's construction differed appreciably from theirs. ""He virtually junked it. Said he had no idea what it could be used for, and didn't know how to operate it."" ""And the telescope?"" ""Oh, he kept that. He said he had some interest in astronomy and meant to develop that if time permitted."" [SNIPPET] You stand still; time moves. Do you get it?' ""I had to confess that I didn't. ""He tried again, with obviously strained patience. Judging by what I could gather from what he said, it was possible for him—so he believed—to get into his machine, twirl a few knobs, push a few buttons, relax for any given period, and end up just where he liked—back in the past, or ahead in the future."
1726,"They could not survive a second raying. Grim shouted. Never before had Hilary heard him raise his voice to that pitch. His great arm was upflung. "" [SNIPPET] And I decided that Adam Bailey did not know what a knight was, though of course he might have been explaining things to Bill Sloggs, but it did not sound like that; so that left Bill Sloggs. I watched Bill Sloggs after that with a certain wonder; he was no more intellectual than the others to look at, though rather more forceful perhaps. Poor old Stavlokratz was beaten again.  Well, in the end I paid for Stavlokratz, and tried to get a game with Bill Sloggs alone, but this he would not agree to, it must be all three or none: and then I went back with Stavlokratz to his lodgings."
1727,"As it stands, the entire responsibility rests on the two of you."" Helen Walden was primly confident. "" I don't see how we can fail to treat the matter with perfect logic. After all, it is not we who neglect our drug levels.... They were refusing to take their drugs, weren't they?"" she asked, hoping for the worst and certain she was right. [SNIPPET] He drew a frown from Meillard with the suggestion. "" Maybe it's supposed to intimidate us."" ""They're probably doing it to encourage themselves,"" Anna de Jong, the psychologist, said. "" I'll bet they're really scared stiff."""
1728,"He saw the man look at the machine; look at the door; look at the chain; look at the hole in the wall; look at the light cord. He saw the man connecting his machine to the light cord; he felt powerless to warn the man that he might be connecting it wrong—that there were two ways: one right, one wrong. An explosion threw the man heavily against the wall. He could see the man struggling slowly up—coming towards him—kicking him. But he could hardly feel the kick at all—and everything got dark. When light came back it was just a small square above him. That puzzled him, until he reached out and found wooden walls all around him—very close. He was in a box. [SNIPPET] I can see from the appearance of your lawn youre a lady who really cares for her garden. I'm introducing to a restricted group—just one or two in each[9] neighborhood—a new preparation, an astounding discovery by a renowned scientist which will make your grass twice as green and many times as vigorous upon one application, without the aid of anything else, natural or artificial."" ""My gardener takes care of all that."" ""But, madam—"" ""There is a city ordinance against unlicensed solicitors."
1729,"Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard with D’Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted D’Artagnan.   In the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII., like all other things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. At first, Athos supported the association for a time with his own means.  Porthos succeeded him; and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed, he was able to provide for the wants of all for a fortnight. [SNIPPET] “Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “Donner und Blitzen!”  This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose—and then called upon my friends."
1730,"If not, then you haven’t a chance. I imagine there are supplies on the ship. They will last me long enough—” Hendricks moved quickly. But his injured arm betrayed him. Tasso ducked, sliding lithely aside. Her hand came up, lightning fast. Hendricks saw the gun butt coming. [SNIPPET] I still haven't met the pilot. October 3, 1 Well, I've met the pilot. He is kind of squat, with a vulturish neck and close-set jet-black eyes that make him look rather mean, but he was pleasant enough, and said I could call him Pat. I still don't know Jones' first name, though Pat spoke to him, and it sounded like Flants."
1731,"she said, her eyes suddenly ablaze. "" Everything, Banning! Can't you understand?"" He released her, lit himself a cigarette, seeking the calmness he knew he must have to keep his thinking clear. He said, ""Perhaps I understand why—a little. But how, Eve, how?"" [SNIPPET] So I think time is like a circular train-track. Unending. We who live and die merely travel around on it. The future exists simultaneously with the past, for one instant when they meet."" Miller's brain was humming."
1732,"""Poltergeist Section,"" he said defiantly. ""What?"" The exclamation was out before I could catch it. He tried to glare at me, but his eyes were pleading instead. ""General Sanfordwaithe said you'd understand."" [SNIPPET] In two weeks, about."" ""Hm-m-m,"" I said. "" But it won't kill him?"" She picked up her cup and led me back to the sofa, sitting down before she answered me. "" Not exactly,"" she said. "" I don't want to talk about it."" That's what all the witches say when you try to get them to do any life-lining. """
1733,"Four hours after Chase came back, we lifted gravs from Earth. Chase was sitting in the control chair, and to give him credit, we lifted as smooth as a silk scarf slipping through the fingers of a pretty woman. We hypered at eight miles and swept up through the monochromes of Cth until we hit middle blue, when Chase slipped off the helmet, unfastened his webbing, and stood up. ""Take over, Mr. Marsden,"" he said. "" Lay a course for Parth."" ""Aye, sir,"" I replied, slipping into the chair and fastening the web. I slipped the helmet on my head and instantly I was a part of the ship. [SNIPPET] Individual churches with congregations in physical attendance, seemed difficult to find. Telepreachers still appeared regularly every Sunday, but their scripts—like everyone else's—had been processed in advance. Denominationalism and sectarianism had waned, too; all of these performers seemed very much alike, in that they were vigorous, forthright, inspiring champions of the status quo. The scientists? But the scientists were a part of the government, and the government was a one-party system, and the system supported the nation and the nation supported the scientists. Of course, there were still private laboratories subsidized for industrial purposes, but the men who worked in them seemed singularly disinterested in social problems. In a way, Harry could understand their position. It isn't likely that a dedicated scientist, a man whose specialized research has won him a Nobel Prize for creating a new detergent, will be worldly enough to face unpleasant realities beyond the walls of his antiseptic sanctum. After all, there was precedent for such isolationism—did the sainted Betty Crocker ever enlist in any crusades?"
1734,"That is why I wanted to be in the sealed cell for a time. We merely pack a quantity of the radioactive salt around the capsules in the lining of our garments, and the radium emanations continue the excitation of the tiny atomic generators even under the influence of the neutralizing vibrations. Do you follow me?""  ""Yes.""  Luke did comprehend, even though the technical explanation was beyond his understanding. They would be able to defy this terrible gravity of Vulcan. [SNIPPET] That way he can spend the rest of his time on duty here for the union, and will know in advance what the test is like."" He turned to Koffler. "" But understand this. You keep your mouth out of it. If you see anything that looks objectionable, make a note of it, but don't try to interfere."" The written tests, done on printed forms, required about twenty minutes."
1735,"Venus could never be colonized as long as those cannibals were there to eat men, and drive men mad."" Cully fingered the scar on his forehead, and looked unseeing into the old man's compassionate eyes. "" I'm sorry Cully. We all are. But there was no other way. Prefrontal lobotomy, destruction of your speech center ... it was the only way you could get past the telepaths and destroy them. I'm sorry, Cully. [SNIPPET] He saw that the other servomechs remained unmoving while they were being tampered with. All of this was data, important new data. ""M-11 will proceed as follows,"" came the sound from nowhere. M-75 stopped ruminating and listened. There was a further flood of sounds."
1736,"he sneered. "" Did she throw you down?"" He could have bitten off his tongue as he spoke. Ulana gasped.  And if Ianito had been in a rage before he was a madman now. Despite his contempt of the misshapen creature, Blaine quailed before the murderous glare that answered his rash words. But the Dictator was master of himself, at that; his lips tightened in a thin line and he held his peace. He actually smiled after a moment, the devil, a smile, though, of evil triumph. [SNIPPET] They were machines. The fighters were machines made for fighting. The people that watched them were machines for stamping and screaming and swearing. The bankers had banking cogs in their bellies, the crooks had crooked cams. A woman was just a loving machine, all nicely adjusted to give you a good time (sometimes!) but the farthest star was nearer to you than the mind behind that mouth you kissed. See what I mean?"
1737,"The young engineer looked down at her, his thin face a pale blur in the darkness.  ""In five minutes, just five minutes, Nanlo, my own,"" he whispered. "" I left the guard half an hour ago, drinking molkai into which I put a sleeping powder. Give him five more minutes to fall asleep, then we can go to the ship unseen, unchecked. Until then, we can wait here in the garden.""  He led her toward the trilling fountain and they sat down upon a bench before it, of rare Callisto crystal. [SNIPPET] she said. "" Richard may have seen I was scared just now."" Outside again, under the tree, she called, ""Here's Cappy's present, Richard. He's gone away and left it for you."" Would he notice how her voice had gone up half an octave, become flat and shrill? ""I'm coming down,"" Richard said. "" Let me down, tree."""
1738,"""Oh, no. Toronto."" ""How'd you happen to join the Navy, if I may make so bold?"" ""Gosh, that's hard to say. But I guess mostly I felt so crowded at home. [SNIPPET] We have to get out of the country of the demons. And maybe—just maybe—if we can cross the Great Range, we can join a tribe that hasn't heard about our being condemned to Hell. There are supposed to be tribes on the other side of the Range, but the cliff people would never let our folk get through to them. That's on our side now."" ""That's true,"" Alaskon said, brightening a little. "" And from the top of the Range, we could come down into another tribe—instead of trying to climb up into their village out of Hell. Honath, I think it might work."" ""Then we'd better try to sleep right here and now,"" Charl said. "" It seems safe enough."
1739,"""No ... God no...."" Russell whispered over and over. "" None of us can ever make it alone...."" Alvar said, ""We each take the star he likes best. I'll go back the other way. Russ, you take the left. And you, Johnson, go to the right."" Johnson started to laugh. Russell was yelling wildly at them, and above his own yelling he could hear Johnson's rising laughter. "" [SNIPPET] But I'm afraid there is no way.—Wait! The Cosmic Express."" ""The Cosmic Express?"" ""A new invention. Just perfected a few weeks ago, I understand. By Ludwig Von der Valls, the German physicist."""
1740,"Well, tell us all about it, Bess."" Their faces were red in the firelight. Hers had the prettiness that the first glance almost exhausts, the prettiness, amazing in its quantity, that one sees for a moment under the light of the street lamps when shops and offices close for the day. She was short-nosed, pulpy-mouthed and faunish-eyed, and only the rather remarkable smallness of the head on the splendid thick throat saved her from ordinariness. He, too, might have been seen in his thousands at the close of any day, hurrying home to Catford or Walham Green or Tufnell Park to tea and an evening with a girl or in a billiard-room, or else dining cheaply ""up West"" preparatory to smoking cigarettes from yellow packets in the upper circle of a music-hall. [SNIPPET] And now it shall be told how Sir Launcelot did battle with Sir Turquine and of what happened thereat."
1741,"A long while. The two men returned to the lifeboat preparatory to leaving. And now the captain stood facing him, and the captain's face was a rigid mask. It seemed with an effort that the captain's right arm remained at his side, but that effort had been ordered. No salute. The captain's voice, too, was rigid with unemotion. "" Number One ..."" [SNIPPET] The fourth was suddenly required to compute the distance to Weald from such data as he could get from observation, without reference to any records. By this time the first man was chafing to take a second turn. Calhoun gave each of them a second gruelling lesson. He gave them, in fact, a highly condensed but very sound course in the art of travel in space. His young students took command in four-hour watches, with at least one breakout from overdrive in each watch. He built up enthusiasm in them. They ignored the discomfort of being hungry, though there had been no reason for them to stint on food in Orede—in growing pride in what they came to know. When Weald was a first-magnitude star, the four were not highly qualified astrogators, to be sure, but they were vastly better spacemen than at the beginning."
1742,"It'll be more comfortable for all of us."" ""Joyce, come back here!"" ""Good-by, Dad."" She waved a shaky hand at her mother. "" Good-by, Mom. See you soon."" [SNIPPET] ""I know, but I've changed my mind. I want it here, now. Oh, Greg, I'm afraid...."" His big russet eyes narrowed, his high-winged nostrils flared, scenting danger. "" You are afraid of what?"""
1743,"They were the only living things in the Big Tank with the honest stink of life to them). "" Where did you plant the marijuana, Johnny?"" the Chief asked me. His voice was muffled by the wetness of his suit-speaker. ""Now, there's a pregnant idea,"" I said. "" [SNIPPET] But nothing could save Oklahoma. By noon the water reached clutching fingers around Mt. Scott and Elk Mountain, deluging Hobart and almost all of Greer County. Despite hopeful announcements that the wave was slowing, had virtually stopped after inundating Oklahoma City, was being swallowed up in the desert near Amarillo, the wall of water continued its advance. For the land was still sinking, and the floods were constantly replenished from the Gulf. Schwartzberg and his geologists advised the utmost haste in evacuating the entire area between Colorado and Missouri, from Texas to North Dakota."
1744,"When Madame Bovary looked up, she always saw him there, like a sentinel on duty, with his skullcap over his ears and his vest of lasting.  Sometimes in the afternoon outside the window of her room, the head of a man appeared, a swarthy head with black whiskers, smiling slowly, with a broad, gentle smile that showed his white teeth. A waltz immediately began and on the organ, in a little drawing room, dancers the size of a finger, women in pink turbans, Tyrolians in jackets, monkeys in frock coats, gentlemen in knee-breeches, turned and turned between the sofas, the consoles, multiplied in the bits of looking glass held together at their corners by a piece of gold paper. The man turned his handle, looking to the right and left, and up at the windows. Now and again, while he shot out a long squirt of brown saliva against the milestone, with his knee raised his instrument, whose hard straps tired his shoulder; and now, doleful and drawling, or gay and hurried, the music escaped from the box, droning through a curtain of pink taffeta under a brass claw in arabesque. They were airs played in other places at the theatres, sung in drawing rooms, danced to at night under lighted lustres, echoes of the world that reached even to Emma. Endless sarabands ran through her head, and, like an Indian dancing girl on the flowers of a carpet, her thoughts leapt with the notes, swung from dream to dream, from sadness to sadness. When the man had caught some coppers in his cap, he drew down an old cover of blue cloth, hitched his organ on to his back, and went off with a heavy tread. [SNIPPET] They would never have it; returning constantly to the assertion that ages ago the divinities were frequently seen, and that the moment their personality was disbelieved in, men would leave off practising even those ordinary virtues which the common experience of mankind has agreed on as being the greatest secret of happiness. “ Who ever heard,” they asked, indignantly, “of such things as kindly training, a good example, and an enlightened regard to one’s own welfare, being able to keep men straight?” In my hurry, forgetting things which I ought to have remembered, I answered that if a person could not be kept straight by these things, there was nothing that could straighten him, and that if he were not ruled by the love and fear of men whom he had seen, neither would he be so by that of the gods whom he had not seen.  At one time indeed I came upon a small but growing sect who believed, after a fashion, in the immortality of the soul and the resurrection from the dead; they taught that those who had been born with feeble and diseased bodies and had passed their lives in ailing, would be tortured eternally hereafter; but that those who had been born strong and healthy and handsome would be rewarded for ever and ever. Of moral qualities or conduct they made no mention.  Bad as this was, it was a step in advance, inasmuch as they did hold out a future state of some sort, and I was shocked to find that for the most part they met with opposition, on the score that their doctrine was based upon no sort of foundation, also that it was immoral in its tendency, and not to be desired by any reasonable beings.  When I asked how it could be immoral, I was answered, that if firmly held, it would lead people to cheapen this present life, making it appear to be an affair of only secondary importance; that it would thus distract men’s minds from the perfecting of this world’s economy, and was an impatient cutting, so to speak, of the Gordian knot of life’s problems, whereby some people might gain present satisfaction to themselves at the cost of infinite damage to others; that the doctrine tended to encourage the poor in their improvidence, and in a debasing acquiescence in ills which they might well remedy; that the rewards were illusory and the result, after all, of luck, whose empire should be bounded by the grave; that its terrors were enervating and unjust; and that even the most blessed rising would be but the disturbing of a still more blessed slumber.  To all which I could only say that the thing had been actually known to happen, and that there were several well-authenticated instances of people having died and come to life again—instances which no man in his senses could doubt."
1745,"There will be one sane man in it, at all events.” Mrs. James said she thought it was very unkind, and if people were all as prejudiced as I was, there would never have been the electric telegraph or the telephone. I said that was quite a different thing. Mrs. James said sharply: “In what way, pray—in what way?” I said: “In many ways.” Mrs. James said: “Well, mention one way.” I replied quietly: “Pardon me, Mrs. James; I decline to discuss the matter. I am not interested in it.” Sarah at this moment opened the door and showed in Cummings, for which I was thankful, for I felt it would put a stop to this foolish table-turning. [SNIPPET] “If I remember rightly,” said Warming, “you were an artist?”  “Was. And then I became a married man. I saw it was all up with black and white, very soon—at least for a mediocrity, and I jumped on to process. Those posters on the Cliffs at Dover are by my people.”"
1746,"—Montgomery A  ""Andre Norton adds another star to her literary laurels.""  —Cleveland P  ""A good, clearly thought-out story.""  —New York T  ""Exciting and adventure-laden."" [SNIPPET] He was in his element: by the sixth sense of born airmen, he knew and could handle any flying machine, no matter how foreign. In a second, his fingers had fumbled onto the starting button. The choke of the motor and then its full-throated roar were sweet to his ears. The lonely golf course and the night re-echoed with the bellow of twelve pistons thrusting in line; watching, one would not have dreamed that a cripple was at the controls of the plane that now swung around with a blast of power, leveled its nose down the course and raced smoothly over close-clipped grass. Its wheels bumped, spun on the ground and lifted into air. A mile to the dam!"
1747,"Silence, save for the droning hum of the helicopter. Then something dropped. It went off with an inadequate sort of an explosion and a cloud of misty white vapor reared upward on a hillside and began to settle slowly, spreading out.... The helicopter moved and other things dropped, making a pattern. ""The air's still,"" said Thorn quite grimly. "" That stuff seems to be heavier than air. It's flowing downhill, toward the dome-wall. It will be here in five minutes. We've got to move."" [SNIPPET] From then on the progress of the party became a mad dash that taxed the endurance of everyone except Layroh himself. After the first hour they entered a terrain so rugged that the cars had to be abandoned and they fought their way forward on foot. Layroh was forced to turn the radiolike apparatus over to one of the men, while he himself carried another mechanism that consisted of a heavy silver cylinder with four flexible nozzles emerging from one end. They held as rigidly as possible to a straight line toward the southeast, scrambling over whatever obstacles intervened."
1748,"Staghorn worked at the geographic adjustment and finally got the screen focused on the corridor again. It was deserted. The bearded man and his companions had already departed. Staghorn touched the controls again, the screen flickered and once more the little park came into focus. But now it, too, was deserted. None of the ragged men and women were in sight, neither in the park nor on the street beyond. Staghorn twisted the focus in all directions without discovering anyone. ""That whistle we heard was obviously some kind of alarm,"" he said. "" [SNIPPET] Wait—I remember now what it was we came here for. But we're not going through with it."" He thought of the festival to come, of the young men and girls running lithe in the dusk, splashing in the lake and calling joyously to each other across the pale sands. The joyous innocence of their play brought an appalling realization of what would happen if the fat outsider on the screen should have his way: The quiet paradise would be shattered and refashioned in smoky facsimile of Earth, the happy people herded together and set to work in dusty fields and whirring factories, multiplying tensions and frustrations as they multiplied their numbers."
1749,"Thus passed twenty months of the life of Rasselas. He busied himself so intensely in visionary bustle that he forgot his real solitude; and amidst hourly preparations for the various incidents of human affairs, neglected to consider by what means he should mingle with mankind. One day, as he was sitting on a bank, he feigned to himself an orphan virgin robbed of her little portion by a treacherous lover, and crying after him for restitution. So strongly was the image impressed upon his mind that he started up in the maid’s defence, and ran forward to seize the plunderer with all the eagerness of real pursuit. Fear naturally quickens the flight of guilt. Rasselas could not catch the fugitive with his utmost efforts; but, resolving to weary by perseverance him whom he could not surpass in speed, he pressed on till the foot of the mountain stopped his course. Here he recollected himself, and smiled at his own useless impetuosity. Then raising his eyes to the mountain, “This,” said he, “is the fatal obstacle that hinders at once the enjoyment of pleasure and the exercise of virtue. [SNIPPET] The next morning Bellarmine breakfasted with her in presence of her aunt, whom he sufficiently informed of his passion for Leonora. He was no sooner withdrawn than the old lady began to advise her niece on this occasion. "" You see, child,"" says she, ""what fortune hath thrown in your way; and I hope you will not withstand your own preferment."" Leonora, sighing, begged her not to mention any such thing, when she knew her engagements to Horatio. "" Engagements to a fig!"""
1750,"Both Jensen and Ungnad admit that Enkidu is to be supplied in at least one of the lines. 97 Lines 109 and 112. 98 Assyrian version, Tablet IX, 1, 8–9. 99 Tablet VIII, 5, 2–6.

1751,"Caswall was genuinely surprised when he saw Lady Arabella, though he need not have been, after what had already occurred in the same way. The look of surprise on his face was so much greater than Lady Arabella had expected—though she thought she was prepared to meet anything that might occur—that she stood still, in sheer amazement. Cold-blooded as she was and ready for all social emergencies, she was nonplussed how to go on. She was plucky, however, and began to speak at once, although she had not the slightest idea what she was going to say. “I came to offer you my very warm sympathy with the grief you have so lately experienced.” “My grief? I’m afraid I must be very dull; but I really do not understand.” [SNIPPET] ""What beasts are they?"" asked the shaggy man.  The captain hesitated to answer. Finally, he said:  ""You will learn all about them when you arrive at their city. But do not be afraid of them. Button-Bright is so wonderfully clever and has now such an intelligent face that I'm sure he will manage to find a way to protect you.""  This made Dorothy and the shaggy man rather uneasy, for they had not so much confidence in the fox-boy's wisdom as the captain seemed to have."
1752,"Government medical authorities met the women at checkup time and demonstrated that the Leff Law had teeth in it. Teeth, and scalpels. The rebellious women were not subdued, slain, or segregated—they were merely sterilized. Perhaps more would have come of this if their men had backed them up; but the men, by and large, were realists. [SNIPPET] Height, weight, life-expectancy have fallen perceptibly every decade since then. The war merely hastened the process."" ""You appear to have devoted a great deal of time to this question,"" Littlejohn observed. ""I have,"" answered the older man. "" And it is not a question. It is a fact."
1753,"Another five, ten, years and it would be the Pioneers' Home for him—if he did not get stove up or sick sooner and die right here in the cabin, too helpless to cut wood for the fire. He had helped bury enough others, bed and all when they didn't come down the river at breakup and somebody had to go up and look for them, to know it was possible. The other world was milder, it had game and fur—good fur, too, from the looks of it, something new that could lick any mutation or synthetic on the market, and the income tax had still left a few fellows who could pay through the nose to see their women look nice. And, the country was new. He'd never thought he'd have a crack at a new country again, a new, good country. Often, he'd thought how lucky people had been who were born a hundred and fifty years ago, moving into an easy, rich country like the Ohio or Kentucky when it was new, instead of the bitter North. The Harn would be a nuisance—Ed did not think of it as the Harn, of course, but just as ""they""—but he supposed he could find a way to clean them out. [SNIPPET] As Ed followed along it, he began to notice a few more signs of life—birds, small scurriers on the ground and in tree tops—and this set him thinking. The country had a picked-over feel to it, a hunted and trapped-out feel, worse where he had first come through, but still noticeable here. The Harn did not like to cross water, it could, but it did not like to. Ed looked at the sun. It was getting down in the sky. If there was any activity at all around here, the ford at dusk would be as likely a place as any to find it. He worked back along the ridge to a point above where he judged the ford to be."
1754,"Where are you? Jenkins!"" He tried to look around him but the bright, intense light revealed nothing. He swore to himself, extending his arms in front of him for something to grasp. [SNIPPET] one of the policeman asked. "" I mean they can't hang you for murder until you commit one, can they?"" ""That's not the idea,"" the captain said. "" The watchbirds are supposed to stop a man before he commits a murder."" ""Then no one arrests him?"" Celtrics asked. ""I don't know how they're going to work that out,"" the captain admitted. The men were silent for a while."
1755,"Tertius, ever among trolls you are little liked, being one of the worst."" Hildigund moaned with terror as the monster swelled in rage. But there was no movement. Only the leaping flames and the eddying smoke stirred. Cappen's voice rang out, coldly: ""Now the king lies on the sea, frozen and wet, and I am come to fetch a brand for his fire. [SNIPPET] I'm not naked. Will you please go away?"" ""Sally!"" It was Mom, appearing in the doorway of the parlor. """
1756,"At last Imlac began thus: “I do not now wonder that your reputation is so far extended: we have heard at Cairo of your wisdom, and came hither to implore your direction for this young man and maiden in the choice of life.” “To him that lives well,” answered the hermit, “every form of life is good; nor can I give any other rule for choice than to remove all apparent evil.” “He will most certainly remove from evil,” said the Prince, “who shall devote himself to that solitude which you have recommended by your example.” “I have indeed lived fifteen years in solitude,” said the hermit, “but have no desire that my example should gain any imitators. In my youth I professed arms, and was raised by degrees to the highest military rank. I have traversed wide countries at the head of my troops, and seen many battles and sieges. At last, being disgusted by the preferments of a younger officer, and feeling that my vigour was beginning to decay, I resolved to close my life in peace, having found the world full of snares, discord, and misery. I had once escaped from the pursuit of the enemy by the shelter of this cavern, and therefore chose it for my final residence. [SNIPPET] These supplies are principally drawn from three sources; the produce of land, of mines, and of fisheries. These afford continual supplies of provisions and materials, of which part is afterwards wrought up into finished work and by which are replaced the provisions, materials, and finished work, continually withdrawn from the circulating capital. From mines, too, is drawn what is necessary for maintaining and augmenting that part of it which consists in money. For though, in the ordinary course of business, this part is not, like the other three, necessarily withdrawn from it, in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general stock of the society, it must, however, like all other things, be wasted and worn out at last, and sometimes, too, be either lost or sent abroad, and must, therefore, require continual, though no doubt much smaller supplies."
1757,"she screamed over her shoulder. "" Burn the cabin! Burn it all!"" She ran on, Ted's answering shouts beyond her comprehension. Fatigue halted her. At the top of the rise between Cappy's farm and their own, pain and dizziness began flowing over her in waves. She set Richard down on the mauve soil and collapsed beside him. [SNIPPET] Remember our slogan."" Malone sighed. He fished in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes, found one, and extracted a single cigarette. He stuck it in his mouth and started fishing in various pockets for his lighter. He sighed again. He preferred cigars, a habit he'd acquired from the days when he'd filched them from his father's cigar case, but his mental picture of the fearless and alert young FBI agent didn't include a cigar. Somehow, remembering his father as neither fearless nor, exactly, alert—anyway, not the way the movies and the TV screens liked to picture the words—he had the impression that cigars looked out of place on FBI agents. And it was, in any case, a small sacrifice to make. He found his lighter and shielded it from the brisk wind."
1758,"Dr. Clayton,"" he protested, ""we aren't making these things up for popular consumption. We're just telling you what we actually saw—that is—what—what—we—saw looked like to us."" Clayton nodded. "" Of course. That is all people were doing back in 1938 when the Martians landed in New Jersey, at the time Orson Welles presented a radio version of H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'. [SNIPPET] And you all think there were three—not four—not two. Three?"" It was agreed. Clayton rustled the pile of newspapers. "" The reports in here vary. I learn with amazement that you gentlemen seem to have missed completely the spurts of flame that issued from the alien ships—flame which is reported to have set a house on fire. And no one seems to have noticed that the invaders, in descending, glided on huge black wings."" Corelli blushed a fiery crimson. """
1759,"You can tell me,"" she said. "" Remember, back in the life-boat, when I told you we were two of a kind? I didn't fit in, either, back home. I belong here too."" She had moved closer to him, in the soft darkness. He could sense her nearness, sense her womanliness. He started to put his arms around her. ""Well,"" a voice said behind him. [SNIPPET] Like the one where he had found Naomi, a green mold covered everything, and pallid fungi, emitting a pale-green phosphorescence, clung to the walls and ceiling of the long corridor. Apparently the dwellers here had rushed out at the first alarm, had died elsewhere. "" This is luck,"" Allan said. "" We shall have a comfortable place to sleep, and food is not far away."" ""How is that?"" ""Why, the stores level is not far below. Most of New York's structures have a number of residential levels at the top, then a floor of retail stores, and below that amusement places, offices, and factories."" ""But whatever food there was must be decayed by this time."" ""The fresh food, yes."
1760,"He could not believe it at first. He felt the sand and water, and felt of himself; there was no mistake. On the plane back to New Jersey he came to certain conclusions regarding the strange power of his device. He tried it again, secretly. Then he made more cylinders. He was the only man in the world who knew how to construct it, and he kept the secret, giving cylinders to selected people. He worked out the basic principle, calling it a kinetic ordinate of negative vortices, which was very undefinitive. [SNIPPET] I thought maybe some day I might hate them too, or learn to like them. But I can do neither, so I am halfway between, and no man can live this way."" She did not answer him. Finally he said, ""It doesn't make sense to you, does it?"" ""No, it doesn't. This is not the time for such discussions, anyway. The Agents have their machines working at top speed, while we sit here and talk."""
1761,"At last we noticed a movement in the crowd which betokened something of importance, and in a moment we saw what it was. A splendid air ship, by far the most beautiful that we had yet seen, was swiftly approaching from below. ""It's the queen,"" said Edmund. "" I thought she'd come."" [SNIPPET] So they two departed and rode into a great forest. And—"" ""Great Scott!"" You see, I recognized my mistake at once. I had set her works a-going; it was my own fault; she would be thirty days getting down to those facts."
1762,"Unfortunately, by then, I'd forgotten the shock and warning I got from the cat. Things moved swiftly, more easily. The GG took over, becoming, in effect, my staff. They'd become more: five different extensions of me, each capable of acting correctly. [SNIPPET] You chaps certainly have done a job. Looks like I'll have to take the backseat from now...."" ""No!"" The two boys were shocked by that. ""Not on your life, Pop! We maybe did fairly well, but we need you, just the same."""
1763,"For some seconds, we both waited on the wall in breathless silence, and then Alec, with a reckless disregard of what might be in store for him, gently let himself drop, and I, fearing more, if anything, than the present danger, to be for ever after branded as a coward if I held back, timidly followed suit. By a great stroke of luck we alighted in safety on a soft carpeting of moss. Not a word was [125]spoken, but, falling on hands and knees, and guiding ourselves by means of a dark lantern Alec had bought second-hand from the village blacksmith, we crept on all-fours along a tiny bramble-covered path, that after innumerable windings eventually brought us into a broad glade shut in on all sides by lofty trees. Alec prospected the spot first of all to see no keepers were about, and we then crawled into it, and, approaching the nearest burrows, set to work at once with our ferrets. Three rabbits were captured in this fashion, and we were eagerly anticipating the taking of more, when a sensation of icy coldness suddenly stole over us, and, on looking round, we perceived, to our utmost consternation, a very tall keeper standing only a few yards away from us. For once in a way, Alec was nonplussed, and a deathly silence ensued. It was too dark for us to see the figure of the keeper very distinctly, and we could only distinguish a gleaming white face set on a very slight and perpendicular frame, and a round, glittering something that puzzled us both exceedingly. [SNIPPET] We'll go into details later. That green stone from which altars are made—you can secure some of it?"" ""Any amount of it."" ""Of it take your full weight. And of the black ore of which you have occasionally used a little, one-fourth of your weight ..."""
1764,"Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That I’d swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you, for there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and I don’t intend to worry my brains over your secrets. So I’ve simply come to swear at you,” he finished, getting up, “to relieve my mind. And I know what to do now.”  “What do you mean to do now?”  “What business is it of yours what I mean to do?”  “You are going in for a drinking bout.” [SNIPPET] “He has carried off my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov murmured angrily when he was left alone. “ Well, let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I want to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help?"
1765,"Penrod's feelings underwent instant change, and in the sole occupation of disliking Mitchy-Mitch, he wasted precious seconds which might have been better employed in philosophic consideration of the startling example, just afforded, of how a given law operates throughout the universe in precisely the same manner perpetually. Mr. Robert Williams would have understood this, easily.  “Oh, oh!” Marjorie cried, and put Mitchy-Mitch behind her with too much sweetness. “ Maurice Levy's gone to Atlantic City with his mamma,” she remarked conversationally, as if the kicking incident were quite closed. [SNIPPET] Sparks and flashes of white flame darted from the ring, penetrating the radiant swathings of the Dweller, striking through its pulsing nucleus, piercing its seven crowning orbs.  Now the Shining One's radiance began to dim, the seven orbs to dull; the tiny sparkling filaments that ran from them down into the Dweller's body snapped, vanished! Through the battling nebulosities Yolara's face swam forth—horror-filled, distorted, inhuman!  The ranks of the dead-alive quivered, moved, writhed, as though each felt the torment of the Thing that had enslaved them. The radiance that the Three wielded grew more intense, thicker, seemed to expand."
1766,"The geiger kept up a fairly steady click-pattern, but never broke into that sudden explosive tumult that meant we had found pay-dirt. I started to feel tired myself, terribly tired. I longed to lie down on the soft, spongy Martian sand and bury myself. I looked at Val. She was dragging along with her eyes half-shut. I felt almost guilty for having dragged her out to Mars, until I recalled that I hadn't. In fact, she had come up with the idea before I did. [SNIPPET] When he crawled down into the lower compartment he hesitated then opened the longest blade of his knife before searching among the dark recesses down there. He found nothing, not even a speck of dust. Back in his chair again he began to doubt his first conviction. Perhaps there really had been some kind of an invisible force or entity outside the bubble. Both Horne and Silverman had said that ""it"" had tried to get in to kill them. They had been very definite about that part."
1767,"""Over the blue waters!"" they shouted in chorus as I dipped my paddle into the diamond-crested wavelets. "" Six hours, adventurous stranger, with the sun behind you!

1768,"""Do you mean you haven't any nuclear generator?"" asked Warburton. He seemed curiously intent about it. Blades wondered why, but nodded. "" That's correct. We don't want one. Too dangerous for us. Nor is it necessary. Even at this distance from the sun, and allowing for assorted inefficiencies, a mirror supplies better than five hundred kilowatts, twenty-four hours a day, year after year, absolutely free."" [SNIPPET] She saw him and darted from the line and curtsied before him. ""Goodbye, good sir,"" she said. Looking up, she showed him a small and serious face. "" Will I ever see you again?"" ""Well,"" he lied, ""I might look in on you sometime."" ""Please do! In a few years, maybe, when you can."" It takes many generations to raise a people like this to our standard."
1769,"Stevens leaped to the communicator plate, and, blond head pressed close to brown, the two wayfarers studied the faint image of the wanderer of the void.  ""That's it, I just know it is!"" Nadia declared. "" Steve, as a computer, you're a blinding flash and a deafening report!""  ""Yeah—missed it only about half a million kilometers or so,"" he replied, grinning, ""and I'd fire a whole flock of I-P check stations for being four thousand off. However, I could have done worse—I could easily have forgotten all the data on it, instead of only half of it."" He applied a normal negative acceleration, and Nadia heaved a profound sigh of relief as her weight returned to her and her body again became manageable by the ordinary automatic and involuntary muscles.  ""Guess I am a kind of a weight-fiend at that, Steve—this is much better!"" [SNIPPET] ""We are far from safe, but we grow stronger minute by minute. Fifty of the greatest minds our world has ever known have been working from the moment of our departure upon a line of investigation suggested to me by certain things my instruments recorded during the visit of the self-styled Overlord. I cannot say anything yet: even to you—except that the Day of Conquest may not be so far in the future as we have supposed."" ""I hate to leave this meeting—it's great stuff"" remarked Seaton as he flashed down to the torpedo room at Fenor's command to send recall messages to all outlying vessels, ""but this machine isn't designed to let me be in more than two places at once. Wish it were—maybe after this fracas is over we'll be able to incorporate something like that into it."" The chief operator touched a lever and the chair upon which he sat, with all its control panels, slid rapidly across the floor toward an apparently blank wall. As he reached it, a port opened a metal scroll appeared, containing the numbers and last reported positions of all Fenachrone vessels outside the detector zone, and a vast magazine of torpedoes came up through the floor, with an automatic loader to place a torpedo under the operator's hand the instant its predecessor had been launched."
1770,"When survival is outside the rules, the rules change."" The eyes of Johnson were strikingly like Meyverik's, dark and unsettled. Only this boy, younger, smaller than the Nordic, had an appropriate skin tone, stained by the tropical sun somewhere in his ancestral past. He dropped his gaze, expelled his breath mightily and pounded one angular knee with a half-closed fist. [SNIPPET] With a shake of his head he tossed it back in place and ran again, feeling the air rush into his lungs with coolness and vibrance unknown since adolescence. No nicotine spasms choked him and the air was refreshing. Then up the hill he sped, pushing hard, as the marigolds and dandelions parted before him. At the top he stopped and looked and smiled ecstatically as he saw the green rolling land and the stream, curving around from behind the house, his house, the oaks forming a secret lair behind it, and he felt the youth of the world in his lungs and under his feet. He heard the voice calling from that house, his house, calling him to Saturday lunch. ""I'm coming!"" he cried happily and was tumbling down the hill, rolling over and over, the hill and ground and sky blending blues and greens and nothing had perspective."
1771,"Though he was equally confounded and incensed at this instance of their perfidy, he durst not manifest his indignation, conscious of the advantage they had over him in divers respects; but repaired, without loss of time, to the lodging of the clergyman who had noosed him, resolved to consult his register, and secure his evidence. Here too his evil genius had got the start of him; for the worthy ecclesiastic not only could not recollect his features, or find his name in the register, but, when importuned by his pressing remonstrances, took umbrage at the freedom of his behaviour, and threatened, if he would not immediately take himself away, to raise the posse of the Fleet, for the safety of his own person.  Rather than put the pastor to the trouble of alarming his flock, he retreated with a heavy heart, and went in quest of his mistress, whom he had dismissed at his marriage, in hopes of effecting a reconciliation, and preventing her from joining in the conspiracy against him. But, alas! he met with such a reception as he had reason to expect from a slighted woman, who had never felt any real attachment for his person. She did not upbraid him with his cruelty in leaving her as a mistress, but, with a species of effrontery never enough to be admired, reproached him with his villany, in abandoning her, who was his true and lawful wife, to go and ruin a poor gentlewoman, by whose fortune he had been allured.  When he attempted to expostulate with this virago, upon the barbarity of this assertion, she very prudently declined engaging in private conversation with such an artful and wicked man; and, calling up the people of the house, insisted upon his being conducted to the door.    The last resource, and that upon which he least depended, was the advice and assistance of his old friend the empiric, with whom he still maintained a slight correspondence; and to whose house he steered his course, in great perplexity and tribulation. [SNIPPET] The Princess and her favourite embraced each other with transport too violent to be expressed, and went out together to pour the tears of tenderness in secret, and exchange professions of kindness and gratitude. After a few hours they returned into the refectory of the convent, where, in the presence of the prior and his brethren, the Prince required of Pekuah the history of her adventures. “At what time and in what manner I was forced away,” said Pekuah, “your servants have told you. The suddenness of the event struck me with surprise, and I was at first rather stupefied than agitated with any passion of either fear or sorrow."
1772,"His voice placed him as a cracker, either south Georgian or native Floridian. ""I'm waiting for Charlie to come home,"" he said, keeping his eyes on the highway. Probably I'd have asked who Charlie was but just then the trailer door opened behind him and his mother took over. I couldn't see her too well because the lights were off inside the trailer. But I could tell from the way she filled up the doorway that she was big. I could make out the white blur of a cigarette in her mouth, and when she struck a match to light it—on her thumb-nail, like a man—I saw that she was fairly young and not bad-looking in a tough, sullen sort of way. The wind was blowing in my direction and it told me she'd had a drink recently, gin, by the smell of it. ""This is none of your business, mister,"" she said. Her voice was Southern like the boy's but with all the softness ground out of it from living on the Florida coast where you hear a hundred different accents every day. "" [SNIPPET] A tall woman, thirtyish, she wore a sort of shimmering green strapless evening gown. Tennant wondered how she maintained it in place, for despite her recent double motherhood, she was almost flat of bosom. He asked her how she was feeling. ""Okay, I guess,"" she said. "" The way they manage it, there's nothing to it."""
1773,"Maybe we'd better be getting back to the road. I feel kind of guilty leaving my model A sitting there all alone."" Dexter followed him back through the woods and climbed into the front seat beside him. The road took them to the main highway, and not long thereafter Jeremiah turned off the highway into another road—a familiar road heralded by a familiar sign that said, SUGARDALE THREE MILES. Two slag deposits marked the spot where once Dexter's proud convertible had stood. [SNIPPET] Of course not."" ""Then why are you giving Earth to them?"" It was a soft question, but it trembled just a little. ""I thought all your people understood the reason by now,"" said Jorun. "" Civilization—the civilization of man and his nonhuman allies—has moved inward, toward the great star-clusters of Galactic center."
1774,"He tensed, watchfully. The rat's grin was set on Ward's dark face. The cord licked out. But it caught Gray's throat instead of his ankle! Ward laughed and braced himself. Cursing, Gray caught at the rope. [SNIPPET] These evil miracles had not been for nothing. He would not be allowed to go unscathed. He drew himself up sharply then, and swore. He had left N'Chaka behind, a naked boy running in a place of rocks and sun on Mercury. He had become Eric John Stark, a man, and civilized. He thrust the senseless premonition from him, and turned his back upon the mountains."
1775,"It's been a rather hectic day in an awful lot of ways."" Something seemed to impede Mrs. Burnett as she came to the threshold. She frowned and shoved her portly frame against something invisible. It apparently yielded abruptly, because she staggered forward into the kitchen, nearly falling. She stared grimly at Ann and looked suspiciously behind her. ""The children have some new toys,"" Ann improvised hastily. "" Sally is so excited over a new dress that she's positively feverish. Let's see now—it was sugar that you want, wasn't it?"" [SNIPPET] He knew that Dawn had manipulated their conversation in the terminal to her own ends. Behind that deftly-phrased patter of words, what else had she tried to tell him? And what had she tried to find out? "" Top level,"" she had said. "" That's logical."" Why logical? Logical to whom?"
1776,"Except for the Projects. Or at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected radioactive particles. However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to ask. And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking Outside. [SNIPPET] ""I'm sorry,"" Sordman said. "" Do you know who he was interested in before he died?"" The girl had big, myopic eyes. "" Our contract ended sixteen days ago."" She took a cigarette from inside her kimono. "" Protector Sordman, could I just talk to you?"""
1777,"The girl had drifted so close to him now that he could feel the warmth of her body and smell the overwhelming fragrance of her perfume. She put one hand on his arm, and Wayne found that he had neither the strength nor the inclination to jerk away. But he protested weakly, ""Now, listen, there's no point in you—I mean—even if we did, I couldn't produce a high dragon bump."" ""What kind of work do you do, mister?"" Sheilah asked softly, drawing herself even closer. "" You know, you ain't even told me your name yet."" ""It's Wayne,"" he said, fumbling in an effort to loosen his tie so he could breath more easily. "" I'm an instructor. [SNIPPET] ""Well,"" the red one conceded, ""let it not be said that Meropians are not tolerant. But, be careful, young man,"" he warned Michael. "" There are other beings less sophisticated than we. Guard your tongue, or you might find yourself in trouble."" He indicated the stalwart constable who, splendid in gold helmet and gold-spangled pink tights, surveyed the terrain haughtily from his floating platform in the air."
1778,"You don't have to bother much. This old son of a gun and I will take over for a while."" Twice again the twinge, the skip. He had no idea where he was until the lights of the Caledonia space board shone below. [SNIPPET] How many of those students do you think you can corral to help us?"" Coffin gulped. "" Six hundred. They're out there in the street right now, howling for a lynching."" ""All right, I want them in here. And I want some monkeys. Monkeys with colds, the worse colds the better."" ""Do you have any idea what you're doing?"" asked Jake."
1779,"That's why the treetops are lower there."" The wind seemed to have let up a little, though the rain was still falling. Alaskon stood up tentatively and looked around. ""Then let's move on,"" he said. "" [SNIPPET] What did it matter? Why should he bear witness against the young man? It would not help the others, and if Seth wanted to lie his way out of Hell, he might as well be given the chance. The Spokesman was looking down at Seth with the identical expression of outraged disbelief which he had first bent upon Honath. "" Who was it cut the blasphemies into the hardwood tree, by the house of Hosi the Lawgiver?"" he demanded. "" Sharp needles were at work there, and there are witnesses to say that your hands held them."" ""More lies!"" ""Needles found in your house fit the furrows, Seth."""
1780,"""What did you do today, Weelbrrr? You look at all the pretty girls?"" ""Nope. I ran footage. Got the palace, climbed the ridge up to the condensation vanes. [SNIPPET] It was strange, but true, that the answers to all their questions were very nearly the same. The Alla-Narova mind said sharply: ""Glenn, come back!"" Tropile withdrew from scanning the distant dark street. He laughed soundlessly. "" I was watching my wife. God, we're giving them fits down there! The Pyramids must be churning things up, too—the sky is full of auroral displays."
1781,"There was a flash of burning oxygen from inside the suit of Dunbar. If he'd aimed right, Russell knew the fire-bullet should have pierced Dunbar's back. Now the fire was gone, extinguished automatically by units inside the suit. The suit was still inflated, self-sealing. Nothing appeared to have changed. The four of them hurtling on together, but inside that first suit up there on the front of the gravity rope, Dunbar was dead. He was dead and his mouth was shut for good. Dunbar's last faint cry from inside his suit still rang in Russell's ears, and he knew Alvar and Johnson had heard it too. Alvar and Johnson both called Dunbar's name a few times. [SNIPPET] It appeared on the platform of the time machine. ""See? Five minutes before I shall place it there, it is there!"" His other colleague frowned at the cube. """
1782,"It also appealed to the well-known melancholy facet of Russian nature. Besides, after pondering for several days, the Red Bloc decided it could not afford to fall behind in anything, so it started its own program, explaining with much logic how it differed. An elderly British philosopher endorsed the movement, on the grounds that a temporary [132]setback in Evolution was preferable to facing up to anything. The Free Bloc, the Red Bloc, the Neutral Bloc and such scraps as had been too obtuse to find themselves a Bloc were drawn into the whirlpool in an amazingly short time, if in a variety of ways. [SNIPPET] Without population control, human beings would now be packed on this surface of this old planet like drupelets on a blackberry! Think of it!"" Wehling continued to stare at the same spot on the wall. ""In the year 2000,"" said Dr. Hitz, ""before scientists stepped in and laid down the law, there wasn't even enough drinking water to go around, and nothing to eat but sea-weed—and still people insisted on their right to reproduce like jackrabbits. And their right, if possible, to live forever."" ""I want those kids,"" said Wehling quietly. "" I want all three of them."" ""Of course you do,"" said Dr. Hitz. """
1783,"He crawled into the bushes; and lay down, lonely and sick. He would stay here. This was failure—and the end. But he was not sorry for having tried. Above him the sky was not blue, now; but a strange, dead grey. Nowhere could he see the sun. The wind sighed mournfully in the trees. He slept. [SNIPPET] No use being in too much of a hurry, y'know.... Meet Dr. Smith. He's a scientist like you...."" The Martian nodded and smiled at them happily. Dr. Smith looked at him long and curiously, meanwhile automatically seating himself in a chair close to the couch."
1784,"Two women who were accredited members of the Female Society were not working under Ottilie's direction, he noticed. Bound hand and foot, they were lying against the far wall of the great central burrow. They were both covered with blood and showed every sign of having undergone prolonged and most vicious torture. He judged them to be barely this side of death. As he was jerked past, he recognized them. [SNIPPET] It was hard on anybody who did more than an average amount of work. It was especially hard on children. The Meat-Eaters helped relieve the situation. Some, with only the minimum of influence from the Broadcasters, ate nothing but meat. They were naturally aggressive morons who were doing no one favors, potential members of a Wolf Pack. Danniels knew how to end the Famine."
1785,"They shook their heads slowly and said:  ""The High Ki are not visible to the people of Twi. Only in cases of the greatest importance are the High Ki ever bothered or even approached by the Ki and the Ki-Ki, who are supposed to rule the land according to their own judgment. But if they chance to disagree, then the matter is carried before the High Ki, who live in a palace surrounded by high walls, in which there are no gates. Only these rulers have ever seen the other side of the walls, or know what the High Ki are like.""  ""That is strange,"" said the prince. "" But we, ourselves, it seems, are to see the High Ki to-morrow, and whoever they may chance to be, we hope to remain alive after the interview."" [SNIPPET] “Oh, it kept me busy while waiting. By the way, 42one of the photographs is loose,” and I handed her that of her son, this time with the face upwards. The ruse was effective, and the conversation took the desired course. “Have you never seen that face before? It is that of Rudolf, my misguided son, of whom you must have heard. Poor boy! Ten years have rolled by since his death.”"
1786,"I refuse to tailor my art to any occasional need. Now, the second cardinal rule...."" Clarey was glad he could absorb the languages and social structure of the planet through the impersonal hypno-tapes. He had to learn more than one language because the planet was divided into several national units, each speaking a different tongue. Inefficient as far as planetary operation went, but advantageous to him, Han Vollard pointed out, because, though he'd work in Vangtor, he would be supposed to have originated in Ventimor; hence his accent. ""Work?"" Clarey asked. "" I thought I was going to be an undercover agent."" [SNIPPET] The big head nodded agreeably. I believe the young angel made a joke; certainly the convulsions in the huge green face made me think of laughter. Then this amiable monster turned up the grass in a patch a few yards square, broke the sod and raked the surface smooth, just as any competent gardener might do, except that he moved with the relaxed smoothness of a being whose strength far exceeds the requirements of his task. I was back in my kitchen with everyday eyes. My angel was exploring the table. I had a loaf of bread there, and a dish of strawberries in cream. She was trying a breadcrumb, seemed to like it fairly well. I offered the strawberries."
1787,"I muttered, just loud enough to make my voice audible above the solemn chanting. "" Are we dreaming?""  ""No, sir!"" Hendricks' eyes were starting out of his head, and I have no doubt I looked as idiotic as he did. "" It's there.""  On the dais was a gleaming object perhaps sixty feet long—which is a length equal to the height of about ten full-sized men. [SNIPPET] Although between Juan Fernandez and the next land westward the distance was three times greater than between it and South America, the Congress seized upon the only island to which it could possibly spread, Sala-y-Gomez, and made of it a veritable fortress against the Grass. Not only did ships guard its waters by day and keep it brilliantly lit with their searchlights at night, but swift pursuitplanes bristling with machineguns brought down every bird in flight within a thousand miles. The island itself was sown with salt a halfmile thick after being mined with enough explosives to blow it into the sea. The world, or that portion of it which had not fully accepted all the implications of the doctrine of submission, watched eagerly. But the ships patrolled an empty sea, the searchlights reflected only the glittering saline crystals, the migrant birds never reached their destination. The outpost held, impregnable. Again everyone breathed easier.[290]"
1788,"It is the secret of many great advances in science. Get off the main line. Stop fooling with the leaves of the tree, and turn to the roots. Invert the problem, if necessary. I was thinking about the narcotics scandal. A teacher at my college had a lovely sixteen-year-old daughter, carefully reared, who was badly hooked. [SNIPPET] ""Lucy."" ""Will you take that little bronze you liked? As a thank you?"" ""I can't do that!"""
1789,"I've done it! Today I split up the lab into two entirely independent operations, K and N. Did it all on my own authority, haven't breathed a word about it to the boss yet. Here's my line of reasoning. On the K end, we can get results, and fast: if it's just a matter of building a pro that works like the real leg, regardless of what makes it work, it's a cinch. But if it has to be worked by the brain, through the spinal cord, the job is just about impossible. [SNIPPET] We were separated during the sawing, but he caught up with me on the way back and said, ""Let's get together soon and have a talk, Ollie. It's been a long time."" He wants to talk about Marilyn, I suppose. Naturally."
1790,"He who wrote, “O fortunatos nimium sua si bona nôrint agricolas,” might have written quite as truly, “O infortunatos nimium sua si mala nôrint”; and there are few of us who are not protected from the keenest pain by our inability to see what it is that we have done, what we are suffering, and what we truly are. Let us be grateful to the mirror for revealing to us our appearance only.  We found as soft a piece of ground as we could—though it was all stony—and having collected grass and so disposed of ourselves that we had a little hollow for our hip-bones, we strapped our blankets around us and went to sleep. Waking in the night I saw the stars overhead and the moonlight bright upon the mountains. The river was ever rushing; I heard one of our horses neigh to its companion, and was assured that they were still at hand; I had no care of mind or body, save that I had doubtless many difficulties to overcome; there came upon me a delicious sense of peace, a fulness of contentment which I do not believe can be felt by any but those who have spent days consecutively on horseback, or at any rate in the open air.  Next morning we found our last night’s tea-leaves frozen at the bottom of the pannikins, though it was not nearly the beginning of autumn; we breakfasted as we had supped, and were on our way by six o’clock. In half an hour we had entered the gorge, and turning round a corner we bade farewell to the last sight of my master’s country.  The gorge was narrow and precipitous; the river was now only a few yards wide, and roared and thundered against rocks of many tons in weight; the sound was deafening, for there was a great volume of water. [SNIPPET] Arowhena and I had a pitched battle on this point, and should have had many more but for my prudence in allowing her to get the better of me.  I am sure that in her heart she was suspicious of her own position for she returned more than once to the subject. “ Can you not see,” I had exclaimed, “that the fact of justice being admirable will not be affected by the absence of a belief in her being also a living agent? Can you really think that men will be one whit less hopeful, because they no longer believe that hope is an actual person?” She shook her head, and said that with men’s belief in the personality all incentive to the reverence of the thing itself, as justice or hope, would cease; men from that hour would never be either just or hopeful again.  I could not move her, nor, indeed, did I seriously wish to do so. She deferred to me in most things, but she never shrank from maintaining her opinions if they were put in question; nor does she to this day abate one jot of her belief in the religion of her childhood, though in compliance with my repeated entreaties she has allowed herself to be baptized into the English Church. She has, however, made a gloss upon her original faith to the effect that her baby and I are the only human beings exempt from the vengeance of the deities for not believing in their personality."
1791,"Was it a bluebird?"" ""Don't be silly,"" Nina said. She picked up the pie plate and brought it toward them. Cecily's face was white and translucent, one hand went to her throat as the child approached. Brimfull of crackling blue fire with a fluctuating heart of yellow, the pie plate came toward them, held between Nina's small, dusty hands. Nina grinned at them. "" I stole it out of the wires,"" she said. Simone thought she would faint with a mixture of joy and fear. "" Put it back,"" she whispered. "" [SNIPPET] Break in on him and tell him I'm waiting out here. My presence is important inside."" ""Sir, Mr. FitzMaugham absolutely forbids anyone to use the annunciator without his acknowledgment,"" the girl protested. He felt his neck going red. "" I'll take the responsibility."" ""I'm sorry, sir—"""
1792,"For an hour he lay awake, assailed by vague fears he could neither define nor understand. When finally he dozed off it was to lose himself in a series of horrific dreams. He dreamed first that he was a castaway on a tiny islet in mid-ocean, that the waters around the island teemed with huge poisonous sea snakes ... hydrophinnae ... and that steadily those serpents were devouring the island. In another dream he was pursued by a horror which he could neither see nor hear, but only could imagine. And as he sought to flee he stayed in the one place. His legs worked frantically, pumping like pistons, but he could make no progress. It was as if he ran upon a treadway. Then again the terror descended on him, a black, unimagined thing and he tried to scream and couldn't. [SNIPPET] Think you could handle the rear guard, if we try to move out of here?"" ""Hell, yes! Just so we're movin'!"" ""O.K. Put it to a vote of the men outside."
1793,"A Power. It was about that time that I drank the bottle of acid. Nobody was trying to poison me. I wasn't trying to kill myself, either. Not even subconsciously. I was just thirsty. All I can say is I did a first rate job with what was left of my insides. Well, they salvaged me again, and what I ended up with was a pair of carts, one trotting along beside each heel. [SNIPPET] Or a prospector. At any rate, he would[48] have food, or would know where it could be procured. They had drifted some hundreds of yards farther and the ground was getting constantly more broken, so the best time to land was as soon as possible. Slowly the little ship settled, scraped on a rock and arrested its slight forward motion, crunching solidly in the stony soil. ""Take a neuro, Tolto,"" Sime advised. """
1794,"Unhappily her mind slipped off it for a whole hour; and at the end she found herself reading sentences twice over with an intense consciousness of many things, but not of any one thing contained in the text. This was hopeless. Should she order the carriage and drive to Tipton? No; for some reason or other she preferred staying at Lowick. [SNIPPET] The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn’t got no answer, because there warn’t no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn’t no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.  “What’s them?” I says.  “Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it’s done one way, sometimes another."
1795,"Go, friends; farewell.""  In his hand Tiedus held the ray pistol they had taken from the captured guard. He would account for a few of the Llotta at least. Blaine reached for him to restrain him; it was unthinkable that this fine lad should sacrifice himself for them. But Tiedus was gone; he had slipped away into the black depths of the passageway.  ""Come on, snap into it!"" Tommy grated, his voice brittle with suppressed emotion. "" The kid's right; let's go."" [SNIPPET] With all his strength, Larry struck at the crystal cylinder, swinging the stool like an ax. A slender, metallic green tentacle whipped out, tore the stool from his hands, and sent it crashing across the room, to splinter into fragments on the opposite wall. Larry, sent off his balance, staggered toward the glittering machine. As he stumbled against the transparent tube that contained the brain, he clenched his fist to strike futilely at it. A snake-like metal tentacle wrapped itself about him; he was hurled to the floor, to sprawl grotesquely among broken apparatus. His head came against the leg of a bench. For a few moments he was dazed. But it seemed only a few seconds to him before he had staggered to his feet, rubbing his bruised head. Anxiously, he peered about the room."
1796,"""Yes."" ""Well, what did you come up with? Why did that switching operation fail out in space."" ""I don't know."" [SNIPPET] ""Well, no."" ""Why, you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it."" The Explorer smiled. It was a gentle dig at his Arcturian homeland, which was smaller than most planets. He said, ""Not quite."" The Merchant followed along the line of his thoughts. """
1797,"Panic began to clutch at the alien. What had he done wrong? Somewhere a wailing sound began—vehicles with glaring red lights swept past him with vicious, explosive noises. He felt a stinging pain in one leg, and glanced down to see it streaked with red. Ahead of him a line of bipeds all clothed in identical blue sacs of fabric had formed, spilling from the vehicles as they halted. The Triomed stopped, sensing mortal danger. Behind him, the mob rumbled. [SNIPPET] With characteristic swiftness, Kemmer outlined his plans and made the necessary arrangements. A guard was posted in the hall with orders to shoot if Johnson tried the door of his room, and Kemmer himself took a stand in the building across the street, facing the hospital, where he could watch the window of Albert's room. As he figured it, the window was the best bet. He stroked the long-barreled blaster lying beside him. Johnson still hadn't a chance, but these delays in disposing of him were becoming an annoyance. Cautiously, Albert tried the grating that covered the window. The Antarian climate had rusted the heavy screws that fastened it to the casing."
1798,"He held his head tightly in both hands to keep it from flying off in all directions at once, and he tried to think. He knew it was important to think—fast and straight. Six hours and forty minutes. That was too long to be unconscious from a simple blow on the head, and his head didn't really hurt that bad. Probably the weapon had still been firing whatever mysterious ammunition it used when it struck him; and when it bounced off his head it had turned, and he'd been caught in its blast. But that didn't matter. That wasn't the important thing. [SNIPPET] ""I see there is no one working them,"" he said. "" Is that done by the villagers?"" ""Our labor supply is transient,"" answered Saranta after a moment's hesitation. "" The laborers who will work our fields—for a wage, of course—are probably in the next town or the one beyond it now."" Alpha Persei was sinking in the western sky when Tardo and Peo took their leave of Saranta and made their way down the road toward their planetary landing craft."

"" [SNIPPET] That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a better look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual with genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in the baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for an indefinite sense of alienness about him. ""Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,"" boomed the Earthman, clapping Zotul on the back. "" Just tell us your troubles and we'll have you straightened out in no time."" All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this occasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner."
1800,"Gefty leaned forward suddenly, switched on the transmitter. "" And now let's pick up a live newscast. There's something else I ..."" His voice trailed off. The transmitter screen lit up with a blurred jumble of print, colors, a muttering of voices, music and noises. [SNIPPET] The Computer never lies."" He drew himself up stiffly as he said this. Then abruptly he consulted the chronometer on the far wall. ""Excuse me just a moment, Mr. Tanter,"" he said. """
1801,"Of these, some were furnished with money for their journey, and came back no more; some were liberally paid for accounts which a few days discovered to be false. But the Princess would not suffer any means, however improbable, to be left untried. While she was doing something, she kept her hope alive. As one expedient failed, another was suggested; when one messenger returned unsuccessful, another was despatched to a different quarter. Two months had now passed, and of Pekuah nothing had been heard; the hopes which they had endeavoured to raise in each other grew more languid; and the Princess, when she saw nothing more to be tried, sunk down inconsolable in hopeless dejection. A thousand times she reproached herself with the easy compliance by which she permitted her favourite to stay behind her. “ Had not my fondness,” said she, “lessened my authority, Pekuah had not dared to talk of her terrors. She ought to have feared me more than spectres. [SNIPPET] The first years of man must make provision for the last. He that never thinks, never can be wise. Perpetual levity must end in ignorance; and intemperance, though it may fire the spirits for an hour, will make life short or miserable. Let us consider that youth is of no long duration, and that in mature age, when the enchantments of fancy shall cease, and phantoms of delight dance no more about us, we shall have no comforts but the esteem of wise men and the means of doing good. Let us therefore stop while to stop is in our power: let us live as men who are some time to grow old, and to whom it will be the most dreadful of all evils to count their past years by follies, and to be reminded of their former luxuriance of health only by the maladies which riot has produced.” They stared awhile in silence one upon another, and at last drove him away by a general chorus of continued laughter."

I think what kept anything from happening between MacReidie and the stoker, or anyone else and the stoker, was that it would have meant trouble in the ship.

But as long as no one began anything, we could all get along."
1805,"There was a tangle of wrecked automobiles in the center of the Queensboro Bridge and they were forced to push them apart to get through. While they were engaged in this arduous work, a drifting ferry bumped into a pier, shaking the dreaming captain into a semblance of life at the wheel. ""I used to like fairy tales,"" moaned June. "" They're dreadful, really."" [SNIPPET] A human could learn to breathe this air! Leaving the gutted library, Betsy breasted the wind as she ploughed through shifting dunes toward a structure shimmering on the other side of the plaza. This, the guides pattered, was a cathedral. When the place now called Dawningsburgh had been alive, they said, its inhabitants gathered at the shrine each evening to sip one ceremonial drink of precious water, shed two ceremonial tears for the days when Mars had been young and worship a flock of atavistic winged princesses who performed ceremonial flights under a pressurized, transparent dome in the rays of the setting sun. This showplace had, of course, been restored right down to its last perch, and had been equipped with a full complement of ""worshippers."""
1806,"I started to make money as though I had my own printing press and managed to hang onto most of it. In spite of what the doom criers say, as long as there is an element of freedom in this country—and I think there always will be—there will be ways, and I mean legal ways, of coming into large hunks of cash. Within ten years, I was not only Big Rich; I was one of the most important people in the world. A Policy Maker. A Power. [SNIPPET] No, Jackson; don't say anything. You said I could make a statement. Thank you. Second, I will state that I am perfectly aware of why the questions are being asked. ""No reaction, Mr. Jackson?"
1807,"We leave you at Tit, to which place you must bring us. Where is the place you proposed to show the Captain?"" ""I did not propose to show it to him; it was his own idea,"" said the Targa coldly. "" The grottos with the inscriptions are three-days' march southward in the mountains. At first, the road is rather rough. But farther on, it turns, and you gain Timissao very easily. There are good wells where the Tuareg Taitoqs, who are friendly to the French, come to water their camels.""

Cf. ka-bit-ta-ki lip-pa-šir (ZA V., p. 67, line 14). Line 100, note the customary combination of “liver” (kabtatum) and “heart” (libbu) for “disposition” and “mind,” just as in the standing phrase in penitential prayers: “May thy liver be appeased, thy heart be quieted.” Line 102.

1808,"I smiled and replied with calmness that amazed me: ""Yes, I daresay you have, Zan Matl Blekeke."" Maxwell and I were alone in the small, bare, brightly lighted but windowless room. Blekeke had spent a half-hour after my arrival trying to find out how much I knew. But after my initial shocker—letting him know that I recognized him—I had kept my mind closed tightly; and I was keeping it closed now. Blekeke was still listening in—I had no doubt of that. Maxwell knew it too, for he made no attempt at conversation. He sat with his back to the walls in one corner, and I crouched in another corner, and we sat there, staring at the walls and at each other, not daring to speak or to think. [SNIPPET] He said, ""Ah, yes. Writer."" He pointed to the defense mech on the seat beside me. "" That typer?"" ""Huh? Oh, no ... that's a portable radio. Carry it around with me, in case the conversation gets dull."" I was at the point where I didn't care much what I said. He must have taken it as a gentle hint, because in a little while he got up and left, shrilling: ""So gladly seeing you."
1809,"This radish, now resting in the vast emptiness of their stomachs, was the last gram of food on board ship. ""Two planets,"" Casker said. "" One's burned to a crisp."" ""Then we'll land on the other."" Casker nodded and punched a deceleration spiral into the ship's tape. [SNIPPET] Stretched as he was on the rack, de Hooch could not think straight because of the excruciating pain. ""Because a half is eight point two eight per cent heavier than a hole,"" said de Hooch. ""You are an idiot, none the less,"" said the torturer. He gave the wheel another twist. De Hooch wanted to scream, but he couldn't. ""Try again,"" said the torturer. "" What is a half plus four plus four plus four plus four plus—"" ""Stop!"" screamed de Hooch. """
1810,"I gotta have some kind of an explanation."" He was almost wailing now. "" What with budgets coming on, and all."" ""Make up your own explanation,"" Kenzie answered disinterestedly. "" It's a cinch you can't give out with the real one."" The Chief began to wheedle. "" You two boys know the explanation. Why can't you tell me? [SNIPPET] And you all think there were three—not four—not two. Three?"" It was agreed. Clayton rustled the pile of newspapers. "" The reports in here vary. I learn with amazement that you gentlemen seem to have missed completely the spurts of flame that issued from the alien ships—flame which is reported to have set a house on fire."
1811,"He did not so much as try to resist the sudden desire. The breeze made him feel a little better, but he was still shaken, and his head ached violently. Little snatches of undefined memory tried to creep into his consciousness, but he couldn't quite bring them into focus. He turned toward the rail, and saw Min-ta still there. ""Well,"" commented the easterner, ""your accounts didn't take long."" Musa smiled wanly. "" It was stuffy down there. I felt I had to come up for some air."" Min-ta nodded. "" [SNIPPET] I can't go, nor let you go. I belong here!"" Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her. She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and out among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they thrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp."
1812,"she asked. ""They come out with us, of course. If kwil is what it takes to stay healthy down there, I've enough to go around. And if it knocks them out, it will keep them out of trouble."" ""Looks like there's a firemaker down there!"" Duomart's slim forefinger indicated a point on the ground-view plate. "" Column of smoke starting to come up next to that big patch of trees!. Two point nine miles due north and uphill of the wrecks."" [SNIPPET] Suddenly they discerned another group of eleven figures in space-suits approaching it from the wreck-pack's interior, rolling up the tube-line that led from the Pallas as they did so. Jandron's party! Jandron and his men had seen them and were suddenly making greater efforts to reach the Pallas. Kent and his companions, propelling themselves frenziedly on from another wreck, reached the ship's side at the same time as Jandron's men. The two groups mixed and mingled, twisted and turned in a mad space-combat."
1813,"""Just what would you do, Mister McCandless?"" The Lieutenant's face was flushed. "" I'm not sure, sir. But I think I would look at it from a strategic viewpoint. [SNIPPET] I looked at the drink Joe was mixing. "" More gin."" Joe crimped half a lime into the glass. "" He won't call any crazy stuff tonight. I told him that if he did, we wouldn't invite him back. He nearly ruined the whole session, didn't he?"" I nodded and took the drink. Joe mixes them right—just the way I like them. They make me feel good inside. """
1814,"""Go, Staghorn, go!"" Peccary shouted. The race would have been lost at once except for the downhill grade. But because of it, Peccary's added weight was a help instead of a hindrance. Shots rang out; bullets bounced from the rocks on either side. [SNIPPET] They were pretty pictures. Cousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the descendants cousin—next assumed guardianship. Ives took his responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm."
1815,"Which would, possibly, be stolen later on. Rastignac, by his illegal rape of geese, was making money scarce. Peasants were hanging on to their produce and waiting to sell until prices were at their highest. The government, merchants, the league, the guild, all saw themselves impoverished. [SNIPPET] Very good."" It was as though he had received information of some kind on an unknown subject through an unknown channel, McLeod thought. Evidently that was true, for his next words were: ""You are not under the influence of drugs nor hypnotic compulsion, I see. Excellent, professor. Is it your desire that this check be converted to cash?"" He made a small gesture. "" You have only to express it, you see."
1816,"The presence of others would have forced recognition of his miserably changed status. Alone, his pride was undamaged. His ego was intact. The long days, and the marigees' screams, the slithering swish of the surf, the ghost-quiet movements of the baroons in the trees and the raucousness of their shrill voices. Drums. Those sounds, and those alone. But perhaps silence would have been worse. For the times of silence were louder. Times he would pace the beach at night and overhead would be the roar of jets and rockets, the ships that had roared over New Albuquerque, his capitol, in those last days before he had fled. [SNIPPET] ""Teddy Kaner first,"" Biff announced. "" He spotted it while you were all watching the flashing lights, only he didn't say anything."" Kaner slipped the ring with the black thread over his finger and started to step back. ""You have to turn the switch on first,"" Biff said."
1817,"""What do you mean?"" she asked, sniffing. ""Look. Forsythe has made his living being a fraud, right? And yet he sent out those warning free—and anonymously. He had no thought of any reward or recompense, you know that. Why? Because he is basically a kind, decent human being. He wanted to do all he could to stop any injury or loss of life. [SNIPPET] John Andrew began to feel quick-frozen again. Being alone at sea in a rickety craft with a possible madman had been bad enough. To have a weird creature with superhuman powers, and an impossible pet monster, added to the crew was a little too much. Garf turned his attention to the television set, which was still presenting its hysterical vaudeville. “ Great-uncle’s gills!” he exclaimed, and lapsed into a fascinated silence. He studied the proceedings carefully, holding the arms-crossed pose again. Finally he turned to Ray. “Weren’t you saying something about civilization a while ago, finless?”"
1818,"Claws reached for him; he felt panting breath, like hot smoke, on the back of his neck; his lungs were bursting, his entire body aflame. He looked down at his fast-pumping legs, doing their job with pistoned precision. He listened to the sharp slap of his heels against the floor of the tunnel—and he thought: I might die at any moment, but my legs will escape! They will run on down the endless drains and never be caught. [SNIPPET] And the buildings towered over everything. He forced himself to look down, and it made him dizzy. The building he was in was so high that it would have projected through the clouds if there had been any clouds. Broom backed away from the window and let the curtain close."
1819,"For upon Pellucidar there is no night. The stationary sun hangs forever in the center of the Pellucidarian sky—directly overhead.  Then, too, she must have been impressed by the wondrous mechanism of the prospector which had bored its way from world to world and back again. And that it had been driven by a rational being must also have occurred to her.  Too, she had seen me conversing with other men upon the earth’s surface. She had seen the arrival of the caravan of books and arms, and ammunition, and the balance of the heterogeneous collection which I had crammed into the cabin of the iron mole for transportation to Pellucidar.  She had seen all these evidences of a civilization and brain-power transcending in scientific achievement anything that her race had produced; nor once had she seen a creature of her own kind.  There could have been but a single deduction in the mind of the Mahar—there were other worlds than Pellucidar, and the gilak was a rational being.  Now the creature at my side was creeping slowly toward the near-by sea. [SNIPPET] There isn’t a man-size game in the lot,” I said.  “But they are interesting—I like them,” Jeff objected, “and I’m sure they are educational.”  “I’m sick and tired of being educated,” Terry protested. “ Fancy going to a dame school—at our age. I want to Get Out!”  But we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. Our special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem."
1820,"I was going to make it. ""... But I would suggest that before committing yourself, you take the precaution of searching Mr. Maclamore's person. One never knows."" I could feel the look on my face. So could Arena. ""So,"" he said. "" Another nifty."" He didn't seem to move, but the stunner was in his hand. He wasn't smiling now, and the stunner caught me easily. [SNIPPET] ""That's a dirty trick she's played on you, Miss Telzey!"" he murmured. "" I tried to warn you."" ""I know."" Telzey took a deep breath. "" Look, Delquos, in just a minute something's going to happen! It'll look dangerous, but it won't be."
1821,"I swung back to the play just at the moment Lady Mack soliloquizes, ""Come to my woman's breasts. And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers."" Although I knew it was just folded towel Martin was touching with his fingertips as he lifted them to the top half of his green bodice, I got carried away, he made it so real. [SNIPPET] Dalon ran his finger around the collar that seemed to be getting increasingly tighter for him. "" I've warned them that the Occupation troops would get them in the end."" He found Graver at a dial-covered panel. The brown-eyed secretary—her eyes now darker and more appealing than ever—was just leaving, a notebook in her hand."
1822,"The ""Infant,"" better known on the records of the A. F. F. as Morgan, David E., Lookout, Station 39-G, was sleeping soundly on the elevating table where a map of the district was mounted under glass. His cherubic face was pink and white, more suggestive of the age of three than of twenty-three. And O'Rourke, glancing at him protectingly, hung up a paper to keep the sunlight from striking the young man's face. The Infant had been Danny's special charge from the day he entered the service, and now, except for the Chief and some other officials, only Danny knew that the Infant was there to teach and not to learn. [SNIPPET] Just what are you planning to do?"" Chambers flicked his hand toward the distant sun that gleamed through the vision port. ""There's a new solar system out there,"" he said. "" New worlds, a new sun. A place to start over again. You and I discovered it. It's ours by right of discovery. We'll go there and stake out our claim."""
1823,"I did not, however, mean to die, and an incident occurred that warned me unmistakably of the folly of letting the days pass so,—for each fresh day was fraught with increasing danger from the Beast People.  I was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall, staring out to sea, when I was startled by something cold touching the skin of my heel, and starting round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking into my face. He had long since lost speech and active movement, and the lank hair of the little brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws more askew. He made a moaning noise when he saw he had attracted my attention, went a little way towards the bushes and looked back at me.  At first I did not understand, but presently it occurred to me that he wished me to follow him; and this I did at last,—slowly, for the day was hot. When we reached the trees he clambered into them, for he could travel better among their swinging creepers than on the ground. And suddenly in a trampled space I came upon a ghastly group. My Saint-Bernard-creature lay on the ground, dead; and near his body crouched the Hyena-swine, gripping the quivering flesh with its misshapen claws, gnawing at it, and snarling with delight. [SNIPPET] They were white, but hideously painted. From their gestures and weapons I took them to be a most ferocious race. I was rather glad that we had not succeeded in landing among them.  Hooja’s fleet had been in much more compact formation when we sighted them this time than on the occasion following the tempest. Now they were moving rapidly in pursuit of us, all well within the radius of a mile. Five of them were leading, all abreast, and were scarce two hundred yards from us. When I glanced over my shoulder I could see that the archers had already fitted arrows to their bows in readiness to fire upon us the moment that they should draw within range.  Hope was low in my breast."
1824,"I tore myself away from my companion and darted to meet it. I discovered it was a shell, a hollow thing, and I passed inside. There was a room there. There were projections and circles of transparent matter. I experienced the symbol dials. There were two other creatures seated close to the dials, things of matter, and their substance was protoplasm. But there was no rationale present in either of them. I examined the living matter of the smaller one swiftly. Organs seemed poised in a suspended state. [SNIPPET] Is this a necessity, a condition peculiar to me as I am, as reason, or is it a condition that came across the barrier with me from that other state? It must be the latter. An entity of pure reason, having come into existence as reason, would need nothing but himself. Why? Because he would be without emotion."
1825,"""Whole new concept of war,"" Kujack agreed. "" Voluntary amputeeism, voluntary paraplegia, voluntary everything else that usually happens to people in a war. Just to get some human dignity back into the thing."" ""Here's how it works,"" Len went on. "" Country A and Country B reach the breaking point. It's all over but the shooting. [SNIPPET] Oh yes, Bell. At first our electronic pawn-pusher wasn't so hot—it could beat the pants off a lousy player, but an expert just made it look silly. But we kept improving it, see, building more and more electronic anticipation and gambit-plotting powers into it, and finally, one great day in '55, we thought we had all the kinks ironed out and were ready for the big test. By this time, of course, Washington had stepped in and taken over the whole project. ""Well, we got hold of Fortunescu, the world's champion chess player, sat him down and turned the robot loose on him. For four hours straight we followed the match, with a delegation of big brass from Washington, and for four hours straight the machine trounced Fortunescu every game. That was when I began to get scared. I went out that night and got really loaded."" What had he been so scared about?"
1826,"“I will put my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour,” says Alan. “ He is an honest and a mettle gentleman, and I would have ye bear in mind who says it. I bear a king’s name,” says he, cocking his hat; “and I and any that I call friend are company for the best. But the gentleman is tired, and should sleep; if he has no mind to the cartes, it will never hinder you and me. And I’m fit and willing, sir, to play ye any game that ye can name.”  “Sir,” says Cluny, “in this poor house of mine I would have you to ken that any gentleman may follow his pleasure. If your friend would like to stand on his head, he is welcome. And if either he, or you, or any other man, is not preceesely satisfied, I will be proud to step outside with him.” [SNIPPET] From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace.  On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a small party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against the lawyer. “ The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “and saw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits."
1827,"What I mean is, your burning zeal—your really bitter disappointment a minute ago—seem a bit out of place. A bit—well, exaggerated don't you know."" Denny halted; and Jim, perforce, stopped, too. Denny's dark eyes burned into Jim's blue ones. [SNIPPET] One hundred and fifty giant ships. All the wealth of Sthor and Asthor had been concentrated in producing those great machines. Every one represented nearly the equivalent of[55] thirty million Earth-dollars. Four and a half billions of dollars for mere materials. Gresth Gkae had the honor of lead position, for he had discovered the planets and their stable, though tiny, sun. Still, Gresth Gkae knew his own giant Mira was a super-giant sun—and a curse and a menace to any rational society. Our yellow-white sun (to his eyes, an almost invisible color, similar to our blue) was small, but stable, and warm enough. In half an hour, all the ships were in space, and at a given signal, at ten-second intervals, they sprang into the superspeed, faster than light. For an instant, giant Mira ran and seemed distorted, as though seen through a porthole covered with running water, then steadied, curiously distorted."
1828,"I was given to understand that if I attempted to take any further part in the proceedings, I would be fed to the nearest alligator. ""What happened?"" Molock yelled, as he danced by again. ""They caught me. You'll have to out-dance him honestly."" ""But I can't go much farther—"" He was covered with sweat and his chest was heaving. [SNIPPET] Will send exact curve plot in half an hour."" Swenson turned to the astrographer. "" Give me a plot for Chicago. I don't want to land her in this state. Just a matter of prudence. She's registered in this state."" The astrographer shouldered his way through the crowd. When he reached the calculators, his swift fingers began pushing buttons. Swenson leaned back."
1829,"""What if this thing can't be stopped?""  ""What if it keeps on and on and invades every city and state?""  ""It is only starting now, but what will it be like a month from now, a year?""  The whole nation awoke to a realization of its danger. The Administration at Washington solemnly addressed itself to the capitals of the world. [SNIPPET] Lura gave a cry of alarm and pressed close to Damis. The sun's rays penetrated with difficulty through a patch of air directly before them. Gradually the mistiness began to assume a nebulous uncertain outline and separated itself into four distinct patches. The thickening air took on a silvery metallic gleam and four metallic cylinders made their appearance. Two of them were about eight feet in height and three feet in diameter."
1830,"A threatening note came into his tone. “ Do not forget that you have a thief for your lover.”  “Yes! Yes!” she whispered, hastily. “ Come nearer! Listen! Do not give me up, Giovanni! Never, never! . . . [SNIPPET] The history of Europe is the history of the victory and breaking up of the Roman Empire. Every ascendant monarch in Europe up to the last, aped Cæsar and called himself Kaiser or Tsar or Imperator or Kasir-i-Hind. Measured by the duration of human life it is a vast space of time between that first dynasty in Egypt and the coming of the aeroplane, but by the scale that looks back to the makers of the eoliths, it is all of it a story of yesterday.  Now during this period of two hundred centuries or more, this period of the warring states, while men’s minds were chiefly preoccupied by politics and mutual aggression, their progress in the acquirement of external Power was slow—rapid in comparison with the progress of the old stone age, but slow in comparison with this new age of systematic discovery in which we live. They did not very greatly alter the weapons and tactics of warfare, the methods of agriculture, seamanship, their knowledge of the habitable globe, or the devices and utensils of domestic life between the days of the early Egyptians and the days when Christopher Columbus was a child."
1831,"No star-gazer, eh? And that's where you come in. There's millions in it. Hell! there's billions. We got to go slow in selling it or we'd bust the market, wreck values and stall reconversion, so we had us a brain-storm when we heard how you cleaned up in the Funeral Market. [SNIPPET] She's for me, and how!"" He took another look at the paper. ""Oh, the hell with it!"" he growled. "" If Jimmie doesn't like it, she knows what she can do about it."
1832,"For it was not really a cave, but a vast underground city whose wide, marble streets stretched away to an inferno of flame and lava. By the terrible light was lit up a great white palace with its gold-tipped scrolls, and closer to me, the golden temple of the Sun, with its tiers of lustrous yellow stairs—stairs worn by the feet of many generations. Above the stairs towered the great statue of a man on horseback. He was dressed in a sort of tunic, and in his uplifted arm he carried a scroll as if for the people to read. His face was turned toward me, and I marveled even in that wild moment that the unknown sculptor could have caught such an expression of appeal. I can see the high intellectual brow as if it were before me at this moment—the level, sympathetic eyes and the firm chin. Then something moving caught my eyes, and I swear I saw a child—a living child coming from the burning city—running madly, breathlessly from a wave of glowing lava that threatened to engulf him at any moment. [SNIPPET] If it be the will of Jon to decide between the men of Klow and the men of Vlamaland, then it is my intent to take a hand in this decision!"" ""Aye, my lad,"" he said tranquilly; and then added, quite as though he knew what my answer must be: ""How do ye intend to go about it?"" ""Like a man! I, Strokor, shall become the emperor!"""
1833,"No, just going through these fugitives from a dentist's office to see if there's anything I haven't read yet. I can't figure out where all the new magazines go. The ones in here always seem to be exactly two months old."" ""Here's this month's Western Stories. I just finished it. It had some pretty good stories in it."" ""No, thanks, the wrong side always wins in that one."" ""The wrong ... oh, I forgot. [SNIPPET] ""All I said was 'Use a firm hitch!'"" I pleaded, trying to shove his shins off my floor-pinned biceps. Artie stared at me, then rocked off my prostrate body, convulsed in a fit of laughter. "" Say it silently in front of a mirror, sometime,"" he choked out. Before I had time to see what he was talking about, I smelled smoke, above and beyond that engendered by the scorched insulation."
1834,"Sylvia sprang up deathly white, but Odile slipped her arm around her and supported her to a chair, saying calmly, ""Sylvia has fainted,—it's the hot room,—bring some water."" Trent brought it at once. Sylvia opened her eyes, and after a moment rose, and supported by Marie Guernalec and Trent, passed into the bedroom. It was the signal for breaking up, and everybody came and shook hands with Trent, saying they hoped Sylvia would sleep it off and that it would be nothing. When Marie Guernalec took leave of him, she avoided his eyes, but he spoke to her cordially and thanked her for her aid. ""Anything I can do, Jack?"" [SNIPPET] Jack, she’s getting better—Jack! where are you? ( Goes in again.) (Jobbins enters D. in F., comes down, saying: Jobbins."
1835,"Let's just be thankful we've saved you from that!"" So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was fear—the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and walk into a man who looked like him—a man who wanted to kill him for the sake of an ideal. But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty pictures. Cousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the descendants cousin—next assumed guardianship. Ives took his responsibilities more seriously than the others did. [SNIPPET] Do you think you can return to walk safely through the city? So""—he drew a hissing breath of surprise when the thought which leaped into Raf's mind was plain to Dalgard also—""you have—there are more of you there! But already Those Others may be moving against them because of what you have done!"" Raf who had been about to join the mermen stopped short."
1836,"""Clear? Are you sure, Anthony, are you sure?"" This other voice, throbbing with vibrant repression as if its owner feared to believe longed-for tidings come at last, was a woman's. As the man half turned, its owner came between him and Allan. All he could see of them was that the one called Anthony was very tall, and thin, and the woman almost as tall, and that both wore hooded white robes, the woman's falling to her heels, the man's to his knees, waist-girdled with black cords. [SNIPPET] ""Naturally. It's insectian, if there is such a word. And a wise man once predicted that the termite organization, being so much more perfect a one than man's, indicated the kind of society man would at some time build up for himself. In ten or twelve more centuries we, too, might go off in millions and deliberately starve to death because the ruling power decided there were too many people on earth. We, too, might devour our dead because it was essential not to let anything go to waste. We, too, might control our births so that we produced astronomers with telescopes in their heads instead of regular eyes, carpenters with hammer and saw instead of hands, soldiers with poison gas sacs in their chests so they could breathe death and destruction at will. It would be the perfect state of society."" ""Maybe—but I'm glad I'll be dead before that times comes,"" said Jim with another shiver. By now the wall ahead of them was complete."
1837,"Any five-year-old could chatemeck—checkmate—me with his brains tied behind his back. But this machine which I built, helped build, is the champion chess player of the world. In other words, my brain has given birth to a brain which can do things my brain could never do. Don't you find that terrifying?"" ""Not at all,"" I said. "" You made the machine, didn't you? [SNIPPET] Orpheus and the souls were classic or later; the three-headed dog was archaic. That was to tell you about the antiquity and invincibility of Hell, and that Cerberus knows Orpheus will never go back into life with his bride. There was the heroic, tragic central figure that looked mighty enough to battle with the gods, but battle wasn't any good against the grinning, knowing, hateful three-headed dog it stood on. You don't battle the pavement where you walk or the floor of the house you're in; you can't. So Orpheus, his face a mask of controlled and suffering fury crashes a great chord from his lyre that moved trees and stones. Around him the naked souls in Hell start at the chord, each in its own way: the young lovers down in death; the mother down in death; the musician, deaf and down in death, straining to hear. Halvorsen, walking uncertainly toward the fountain, felt something break inside him, and a heaviness in his lungs."
1838,"Forgive me for your sorrow."" And I forgave him, as I had forgiven him long ago. For his duty was to men, not to ourselves who were part of that duty. And Charpantier, I knew, had nothing to forgive, for he was glad of his sorrow. The wind numbed my eyes. I wept. Under the cold stars, my crude cheeks glistened. [SNIPPET] Stand fast down there. I'm setting off the first flare now."" A silent explosion of light, searing and unendurable, blasted the night. Farrell cried out and shielded his eyes with his hands, his ecstasy of anticipation draining out of him like heady wine from a broken urn. Full memory returned numbingly."
1839,"Yield up the talisman, and be the shield at my back. I have offered no other man that honor."" Stark asked slowly, ""Why do you choose me?"" ""We are of one blood, Stark, though we be strangers."" The Earthman's cold eyes narrowed. "" What would your red wolves say to that? [SNIPPET] Light flooded the dark as the door clanged open. Ward leaped like a startled rabbit, but the light speared him, held him. Ward felt a pulse of excitement beat up in him. The long ominous shadows of the guards raised elongated guns. The barracks stirred and muttered, like a vast aviary waking. ""Ward and Gray,"" said one of the guards. "" Moulton wants you."""
1840,"The whole adult colony had been out on what they used as a parade ground—it had once been a football field, Haendl said. They had done their regular twice-a-week infantry drill, that being one of the prices one paid for living among the free, progressive Wolves instead of the dull and tepid sheep. Tropile was mightily winded, but he cast himself on the ground near Haendl, caught his breath and said: ""Haendl—about meditation."" ""What about it?"" ""Well, perhaps you don't really grasp it."" Tropile searched for words. He knew what he wanted to say. How could anything that felt as good as Oneness be bad? And wasn't Translation, after all, so rare as hardly to matter? [SNIPPET] Inwardly exultant, though outwardly pulling a long face that was supposed to suggest his sadness at having to leave the Duchess, he backed out of the dining room. Not very gracefully, for Alzo chose that moment to refuse to get out of Green's path. Green tumbled backward, sprawling over the huge mastiff, who snarled with anger and trembled with hypocritical indignation and bared his fangs with the intention of tearing Green apart. The Earthman did not try to rise, because he did not want to give Alzo an excuse for jumping him. Instead he bared his own teeth and snarled back. The hall roared with laughter and the Duke, holding his sides, tears running from his bulging eyes, rose and staggered over to where the two faced each other on all fours. He clutched Alzo's spike-studded collar and dragged him away, meanwhile choking out a command to Green to take off while the taking off was good. Green swallowed his anger, thanked the Duke and left."
1841,"New studies on the key protein chains of the genes were the foundation stones of my plan. The disease had to be highly specific and deadly. I couldn't risk even the remotest possibility of harming food plants in a hungry world. But, as I've said, with no false modesty, I'm no slouch in my field of biochemistry. I took a harmless poppy rust from our California flowers here, and treated its genes with certain chemicals. It was a matter of six months, and well over eighty tries, but finally I came up with a virus that killed the opium poppy like smallpox wiped out the Sioux. No; more than that. [SNIPPET] As I've said, dumb students are nothing new to me. But even the worst of them couldn't have been any more obtuse than Bishop. I had the dead plants, all brown and withered. There were simple charts showing exactly, in terms of time, how the virus worked, killing the poppy within forty-eight hours, and even destroying the viability of any seeds that might be ripening. Did this jughead appointed by the President to fight the terrible drug problem comprehend the miracle being offered to him? The simple solution that would make him the greatest—in fact, the only—success in his post that this country had ever known? Not he. I had to spell it out in nursery school terms."
1842,"Henry Menton, solr, Martin Cunningham, John Power, eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora (must be where he called Monks the dayfather about Keyes’s ad) Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus, Stephen Dedalus B.

Boom (as it incorrectly stated) and the line of bitched type but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M’Coy and Stephen Dedalus B. A. who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their total absence (to say nothing of M’Intosh) L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A. engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints.  —Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.  —It is. [SNIPPET] “We have free speech here. I will not go till I choose.”  “Aye, but you will,” said the old man, and turned on him with a sudden tightening of the brows. There was no blow passed; even the Symbol, which glowed like a star against the night, was not so much as lifted in warning; but the young man tried to retort, and, finding himself smitten with a sudden dumbness, turned with a spasm of fear, and jumped back whence he had come. The crowd of them thrilled expectantly, and when no further portent was given, they began to shout that a miracle should be shown them, and then perchance they would be persuaded back to the old allegiance.  The old man stooped and glowered at them in fury. “ You dogs,” he cried, “you empty-witted dogs! Do you ask that I should degrade the powers of the Higher Mysteries by dancing them out before you as though they were a mummers’ show?"
1843,"They had started their descent from Mount Wendel at the first gray streak of dawn in the east. They had toiled painfully across the broken country between, to this point of vantage. Now Thorn looked down upon the rocket-ship. It lay a little askew upon the ground, seeming to be partly buried in the earth. A hundred feet and more in length, it was even more obviously a monstrosity as he looked at it in the bright light of day. But now it was not alone. Beside it a white tower reared upward. [SNIPPET] Calhoun made use of those resources. He acted as if he were completely unconscious of the stowaway. But Murgatroyd watched her with charmed attention. Hours after her discovery, she said uneasily; ""Please?"""
1844,"""This will happen to all of your Earth unless the ores are given us."" The titan closed a switch. On the first screen flashed the picture of a huge tower such as Phobar had seen in the metal city. Garboreggg adjusted a second control that was something like a range-finder. He pressed a third lever—and from the tower leaped a surge of terrific energy, like a bolt of lightning a quarter of a mile broad. The giant closed another switch—and on the second plate flashed a picture of New York City. [SNIPPET] Kennedy sprang to his feet. "" There is no reference in this log to—"" Mason turned on him. "" Shut up, you fool!"""
1845,"For persuasion was the chief weapon of the Sirian Combine. Outright force was absolutely forbidden, save by the aforesaid vote of the council. Every weapon in the book of persuasion was used to bring intelligent races into the Combine, and persuasion is a thing of infinite variety.    As these thoughts flashed through Powers' mind, he seated himself in a plain chair and adjusted the Universal Speaker to his mouth. Beside him, on a more elaborate chair, tailored to fit his tail, Mazechazz did the same, while the four Falsethsa seated themselves on low stools and took similar instruments from the oblong table which separated them from the two Surveymen. Deep in the bowels of the ship, a giant translator switched on, to simultaneously translate and record the mutually alien tongues as they were spoken. Adjustable extensions on the speakers brought the sound to the bone of the skull. For different life forms, different instruments would have been necessary and were provided for. [SNIPPET] The children told the story."" "" There only one Labuerre was."" "" Easy with the tubing."" "" Let him rest."" Daylight dazzled his eyes. ""Why you were so foolish?"""
1846,"Edna opened her eyes as soon as his weight left the bed. "" Like hotcakes for breakfast?"" ""Eggs,"" he said. "" Bacon."" And then, seeing her face change, he remembered. "" Course,"" he muttered. "" Can't have bacon. [SNIPPET] It rang true; Brennan could understand Tim Fisher's stated reaction and the man's desire to collect. Brennan even suspected that Fisher might use the reward money for his own private purpose. It was not until he read the letter for the third time that he saw the suggestion to move with caution and secrecy not as its stated request to protect the writer, but as an excellent advice for his own guidance. And then Paul Brennan realized that for six years he had been concentrating upon the single problem of having James Holden returned to his custody, and in that concentration he had lost sight of the more important problem of achieving his true purpose of gaining control of the Holden Educator. The letter had not been the end of a long quest, but just the signal to start. Paul Brennan of course did not give a fig for the Holden Estate nor the welfare of James. His only interest was in the machine, and the secret of that machine was locked in the young man's mind and would stay that way unless James could be coerced into revealing it."
1847,"But his eyes, instead of losing themselves in the distance as before, remained fixed upon the sand at his feet. Fortunately so, or he must have failed to notice the long shadow that hung poised for an instant above his right shoulder and then darted downward, menacing, deadly. An infinitesimal fraction of a second, yet within that brief space Constans had contrived to fling himself, bodily, forward and sideways from his seat. The spear-shaft grazed his shoulder and the blade buried itself in the sand. The treacherous assailant, overbalanced by the force of his thrust, toppled over the log and fell heavily, ignominiously, at the boy's side. In the indefinite background some one laughed melodiously. Constans was up and out upon the forest track before his clumsy opponent had begun to recover his breath. It was almost too easy, and then he all but[Pg 6] cannoned plump into a horseman who sat carelessly in his saddle, half hidden by the bole of a thousand-year oak. The cavalier, gathering up his reins, called upon the fugitive to stop, but Constans, without once looking behind, ran on, actuated by the ultimate instinct of a hunted animal, zigzagging as much as he dared, and glancing from side to side for a way of escape. [SNIPPET] We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his arm.  “Do you know what’s over there?” I said, pointing at the pine tops that hid the Martians.  “Eh?”"
1848,"They were firmly planted in the ground, and upon them the strokes of the broadsword were directed.  At Devlen the pels stood just back of the open and covered tilting courts and the archery ranges, and thither those lads not upon household duty were marched every morning excepting Fridays and Sundays, and were there exercised under the direction of Sir James Lee and two assistants. The whole company was divided into two, sometimes into three parties, each of which took its turn at the exercise, delivering at the word of command the various strokes, feints, attacks, and retreats as the instructors ordered.  After five minutes of this mock battle the perspiration began to pour down the faces, and the breath to come thick and short; but it was not until the lads could absolutely endure no more that the order was given to rest, and they were allowed to fling themselves panting upon the ground, while another company took its place at the triple row of posts.  As Myles struck and hacked at the pel assigned to him, Sir James Lee stood beside him watching him in grim silence. The lad did his best to show the knight all that he knew of upper cut, under cut, thrust, and back-hand stroke, but it did not seem to him that Sir James was very well satisfied with his skill.  “Thou fightest like a clodpole,” said the old man. “ Ha, that stroke was but ill-recovered. Strike me it again, and get thou in guard more quickly.” [SNIPPET] ""I don't blame you for thinking that,"" he said. "" Once the Flatheads had no brains because, as you say, there is no upper part to their heads, to hold brains. But long, long ago a band of fairies flew over this country and made it all a fairyland, and when they came to the Flatheads the fairies were sorry to find them all very stupid and quite unable to think. So, as there was no good place in their bodies in which to put brains the Fairy Queen gave each one of us a nice can of brains to carry in his pocket and that made us just as intelligent as other people."
1849,"A kind of fiesta began in the clearing beside the Ceres. The natives built fires to cook the food. The women, scantily dressed if they were clothed at all, danced sensuously in the bright sunlight to a peculiarly exotic, minor-keyed music played on reed and percussion instruments. Laughing gaily, they enticed members of Lord’s crew to join them. The milky drink proved mildly intoxicating—yet different from the stimulants used in the Federation. Lord drank a long draught from a mug brought him by one of the women. The effect was immediate. He felt no dulling of his reason, however; no loss of muscular control, but instead a stealthy relaxation of mental strain joined with a satisfying sense of physical well-being. [SNIPPET] Why don't they kill me and get it over with?"" ""They haven't a license to kill. Not yet. There's legislation going on."" ""Listen,"" I said, listening to the idea coming into my head, ""listen. These descendants of your mother's relatives—they did inherit money because your father died. Maybe they feel grateful to me. Maybe they would help me."
1850,"If he were the boy again knowing all he knew today, still the flaw would be there and sooner or later the same thing must have happened that had happened twenty years ago. He had been born for a wilder age, when men took what they wanted and held what they could without respect for law. Obedience was not in him, and so— As vividly as on that day it happened he felt the same old surge of anger and despair twenty years old now, felt the ray-gun bucking hard against his unaccustomed fist, heard the hiss of its deadly charge ravening into a face he hated. He could not be sorry, even now, for that first man he had killed. But in the smoke of that killing had gone up the columned house and the future he might have had, the boy himself—lost as Atlantis now—and the girl with the honey-colored hair and much, much else besides. It had to happen, he knew. He being the boy he was, it had to happen. [SNIPPET] Tears in the eyes. He lay very still, remembering. Curious how vividly it all came back, though the house had been ashes for nearly twenty years, and the girl—the girl . He rolled over violently, opening his eyes. No use remembering her."
1851,"He returned and added a notation to each. The sun moved imperceptibly across the sky. It seemed to hover above the horizon for a long while before slipping beyond the rim. Night seemed eternal. Crag worked and slept and waited. He measured his oxygen, rationed his food, and planned. He was tough. [SNIPPET] It had to be now! ""Tell me. I command you,"" I cried. "" What are you waiting for?"" His voice was quiet as he murmured, softly, implacably, before he was gone. ""We are waiting,"" he said, ""for you.""

1852,"""Is it? For the secret of not dying?"" ""Not dying? You think we have not-dying for sale here?"" The Martian spoke to the others again. [SNIPPET] Geoffrey twitched his head involuntarily, realized what he'd done, and threw himself off his feet, pulling Dugald with him and just escaping the downward arc of Dugald's plunging knife. The momentum of Dugald's swing, combined with Geoffrey's weight, pulled him completely over Geoffrey's shoulder. The two of them jerked abruptly flat on the ground, their shoulders wrenched, sprawled out facing each other and tied together like two cats on a string. The crowd shouted."
1853,"What I want out of you is a measurement of how great her accuracy is."" Norty snorted. "" When Maragon doesn't believe it?"" he said. "" No thanks."" He started the card sorter, filling the room with its clatter. [SNIPPET] We cannot kill their emissary here, or subject him to serious pain or injury, since we would pay a completely disproportionate penalty in doing it. ""However, that doesn't mean that we should surrender to the Mars Convicts. In fact, for all their cleverness, they appear to be acting out of something very close to desperation. They have gained no essential advantage through their trick, and we must assume they made the mistake of underestimating us."
1854,"Along the belly some observers saw half a mile of paired protuberances that looked like teats. She was unquestionably the equivalent of a vertebrate. Two web-footed legs were drawn up close against the cigar-shaped body. The vast, rather narrow, inflated wings could not have been held or moved in flight without a strong internal skeleton and musculature. Theorists later argued that she must have come from a planet with a high proportion of water surface, a planet possibly larger than Earth though of about the same mass and with a similar atmosphere. She could rise in Earth’s air. And before each thunderous lament she was seen to breathe. It was assumed that immense air sacs within her body were inflated or partly inflated when she left the ship, possibly with some gas lighter than nitrogen. [SNIPPET] She's at the Civic Welfare meeting."" Somehow I hadn't expected anything like that. ""Thank you,"" I said and hung up, and after a moment noticed I was holding a box of red gummed stars in my hand. I closed it and put it down on top of the graph of membership in the sewing circle. No more members."

1856,"The kingsman wore his second gaudiest uniform—the most splendid was reserved for coronations—and carried his silver mace of authority. The godsman was naked, as above display and free of the temptations of sex. He carried nothing, for his nakedness was his badge of office. It was death for anyone except a godsman or a godswoman to be found in a public place unclothed. There came next the Candidate and his master, and after them by two's the whole body of scientists. [SNIPPET] Simultaneously the crashing of the fierce horde behind sounded with appalling nearness—the noise and odor of the ants preventing the huge termite guard in front of the men from recognizing and approving the smell of the termite-paste that covered their bodies. ""Follow me!"" snapped Denny, remembering that the hideous attacking thing before them was blind, and gaining from that knowledge swift inspiration. Jim gathered his muscles to follow at command. But he almost shouted aloud as he saw Denny leap—straight toward the enormous, snapping mandibles."
1857,"Jim and Denny stooped to peer under the blanket of cloud. The dog! In what way had it been affected? Again they exclaimed aloud, involuntarily, unconsciously. There was no dog to be seen. [SNIPPET] Only too obviously, the intricate secret of atomic power had not let itself be solved. On the heels of the elation that filled his heart, came a sickening realization of his dilemma. He could not have told the Rogans what they wanted to know even if he had wished to! He himself didn't know the principles of the atomic engine. As Brand had remarked, he was no space navigator; he was simply a prosaic lieutenant, competent only at fighting, not at all versed in science. He knew, though, that it would do no good to assert his ignorance to the Rogans."
1858,"""At the time that John Jones died, the amount in the First National Bank of Chicago to the credit of John Jones the fortieth, was as follows."" The professor seized the chalk and wrote rapidly upon the oblong space: ""The peculiar sinuous hieroglyphic,"" he explained, ""is an ideograph representing the Dollar. ""Well, gentlemen, time went on as time will, until a hundred years had passed by. The First National Bank still existed, and the locality, Chicago, had become the largest center of population upon the earth. Through the investments which had taken place, and the yearly compounding of interest, the status of John Jones's deposit was now as follows."" He wrote: ""In the following century, many minor changes, of course, took place in man's mode of living; but the so-called socialists still agitated widely for the cessation of private ownership of wealth; the First National Bank still accepted Dollars for safe keeping, and the John Jones Dollar still continued to grow. [SNIPPET] We must give Vic a hand—mustn’t we? H Naturally, I didn’t understand Vic’s jargon about frequencies and light-rays, for I thought more about football than physics in college, but two things were clear to me. One was that Vic had plunged into some sort of wild experiment, and the other was that Hope had followed him. The rest didn’t matter very much. “Perrin! Mr. Butler and Miss Hope are safe. Everything is explained in this note. You and Mrs. Perrin are to leave me here, and not disturb anything."
1859,"Gregrill would be wasted here. Earth, despite all its hatefulness for her, was the only place where his genius would have a chance to unfold and display its potentialities. ""It is time that we go back?"" Gregrill asked. "" You are cold?"" Suddenly, helplessly, Joyce began to laugh. ""What is it?"" [SNIPPET] Lunch, and the robot's chores were usually finished. The two would sit on the packing case and watch the stars. They would talk until supper, and sometimes late into the endless night. In time, Mark built more complicated conversations into Charles. He couldn't give the robot free choice, of course, but he managed a pretty close approximation of it. Slowly, Charles' personality emerged. But it was strikingly different from Mark's. Where Mark was querulous, Charles was calm."
1860,"The only things he can do, are already being done much better by robots."" There was a long silence, broken at last by one little, old council member. ""I have it,"" he cried. "" The very thing. We'll make him guard of the Treasure."" ""But there's no need of a guard. No one will touch the Treasure without permission. [SNIPPET] He and Jan made their way toward the girl. Mara's hand caught his in the darkness. ""Now the car,"" Erick said. "" If they haven't got to it."" He slid down the slope into the ravine, fumbling in the darkness, reaching and holding onto the handle of the case."
1861,"I think I have previously explained that even in the unchanging darkness of space, we divided time arbitrarily into days and nights). "" Unless I'm badly mistaken, Hendricks is falling victim to a pair of blue eyes."" ""He's young,"" I shrugged. "" We'll be there in two more days, and then we'll be rid of her."" ""Yes,"" nodded Correy, ""we'll be there in a couple of days. And we'll be rid of her, I hope. But—suppose it should be serious, sir?"" ""What do you mean?"" I asked sharply. [SNIPPET] Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.  As soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up. Gregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into his chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What a life! This is what peace I get in my old age!”"
1862,"Twenty minutes later, the Starduster hovered for a moment over Aurora, then shimmered and vanished as it went into subspace. OCTOBER 2, 435th Year GALACTIC E The Starduster materialized just outside the atmosphere of the planet Elysia, and fluttered erratically downward, like a wounded bird. A hundred feet from the surface, the ship hesitated, shuddered throughout her length, then dropped like a plummet, crashing heavily into a grove of trees. For Tee there was a long period of blessed darkness, of peace, of non-remembering, then his mind clawed upward toward consciousness. The fear and uncertainty were with him again—nagging, nibbling, gnawing at his reason. He fought to close his mind and drift back down into the darkness of peace and forgetting, but contrarily the past marched in review before his consciousness: The twin worlds of Thole revolving about each other as he fled down the shallow ravine before the creeping wall of lava, while the ancient mountain grunted and belched, and coughed up its insides. [SNIPPET] As he watched, the minute hand jerked [133] downward and an involuntary gasp escaped his lips. The bartender turned quickly. "" Anything wrong?"" ""N ... no, nothing."" As he spoke, the minute hand moved again and Tee started nervously, upsetting his drink. He sat for a moment watching the bartender mop up the spreading liquid, then abruptly got up and tossed a half-credit piece on the bar. He hurried outside, steeling himself to keep from running. He paused just outside the door."
1863,"An alien presence, a rude fist through the canvas negated the convention that this was a picture of reality. A coneshaped hill rose to a blurred point, marking the burialplace of the Dinkman house. It was a child's drawing of a coneshaped hill, done in green crayon; too symmetrical, too evenly and heavily green to be a spontaneous product of nature; man's unimaginative hand was apparent in its composition. The sides of the cone flowed past the doors and windows of the adjacent houses, blocking them as it had previously blocked the Dinkmans', but their inhabitants, forewarned, had gone. More than mere desertion was implied in their going; there was an implicit surrender, abandonment to the invader. The base of the cone, accepting capitulation and still aggressive, had reached to the lawns beyond, warning these householders too to be ready for flight; over backfences to dwellings fronting another street, and establishing itself firmly over the concrete pavement before the Dinkmans' door.[59] I would be suppressing part of the truth if I did not admit that for the smallest moment some perverted pride made me cherish this hill as my work, my creation. But for me it would not have existed. I had done something notable, I had caused a stir; it was the same kind of sensation, I imagine, which makes criminals boast of their crimes. [SNIPPET] So we circled back to let Leroy take a look at it, and when we found it, we landed. The thing had completed just two rows of bricks since Tweel and I left it, and there it was, breathing in silicon and breathing out bricks as if it had eternity to do it in—which it has. Leroy wanted to dissect it with a Boland explosive bullet, but I thought that anything that had lived for ten million years was entitled to the respect due old age, so I talked him out of it. He peeped into the hole on top of it and nearly got beaned by the arm coming up with a brick, and then he chipped off a few pieces of it, which didn't disturb the crea[Pg 34]ture a bit. He found the place I'd chipped, tried to see if there was any sign of healing, and decided he could tell better in two or three thousand years."
1864,"In my own humble judgment, and though I have to say it against my own son, this seems an act of treachery. This morning I receive a letter from Perkupp, informing me that Lupin’s services are no longer required, and an interview with me is desired at eleven o’clock. I went down to the office with an aching heart, dreading an interview with Mr. Perkupp, with whom I have never had a word. I saw nothing of Lupin in the morning. He had not got up when it was time for me to leave, and Carrie said I should do no good by disturbing him. My mind wandered so at the office that I could not do my work properly. As I expected, I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, and the following conversation ensued as nearly as I can remember it. [SNIPPET] In such a crowd you could see on all sides of you nothing but a Line, apparently straight, but of which the parts would vary irregularly and perpetually in brightness or dimness. Even if you had completed your third year in the Pentagonal and Hexagonal classes in the University, and were perfect in the theory of the subject, you would still find that there was need of many years of experience, before you could move in a fashionable crowd without jostling against your betters, whom it is against etiquette to ask to ""feel"", and who, by their superior culture and breeding, know all about your movements, while you know very little or nothing about theirs. In a word, to comport oneself with perfect propriety in Polygonal society, one ought to be a Polygon oneself. Such at least is the painful teaching of my experience.  It is astonishing how much the Art—or I may almost call it instinct—of Sight Recognition is developed by the habitual practice of it and by the avoidance of the custom of ""Feeling"". Just as, with you, the deaf and dumb, if once allowed to gesticulate and to use the hand-alphabet, will never acquire the more difficult but far more valuable art of lipspeech and lip-reading, so it is with us as regards ""Seeing"" and ""Feeling""."
1865,"Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing forced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her shoulder, ""You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you."" ""Wait! You mean you don't know?"" [SNIPPET] Of all things! What would the family think! What would great Aunt Mary Hayes say?"" Mrs. Johns-Hayes puffed out even farther than usual. ""Well, we can ease your mind on that subject, Colonel. The history books say that you married Miss Sayles—and here is Mrs. Johns-Hayes to prove it."" The Colonel scratched his chin again as he looked at Mrs. Johns-Hayes. "" Is that so? Is that so?"
1866,"The carpet undoubtedly counteracted it, and they changed to the dining-room. The round table, which was on rollers, glided towards the right-hand side. The operators, without displacing their fingers, followed its movements, and of its own accord it made two turns. They were astounded. Then M. Alfred articulated in a loud voice: ""Spirit, how do you find my cousin?"" [SNIPPET] I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a domestic’s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house. In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable state.  “You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!” I exclaimed, assuming the cheerful; “and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if you can afford me shelter during that space.”  “Half an hour?” he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; “I wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in."
1867,"A colony is a waste of effort unless it becomes more than self-sufficient. Until Eden, Tau Ceti, has become populated to the point where Eden can support her own highly technical culture, it is an economically unsound proposition."" The commander glared at the young spaceman. "" Must I be blunt? Every effort must be spent in raising the culture-level of Eden, Tau Ceti. [SNIPPET] The Northern tip of Africa came up fast. The Dark Continent of history seen from the borders of space was a yellow-green splotch hemmed by blue. The satelloid was still beyond the Aztec's radar range but a data link analog painted in the relationship between the two space vehicles. The instrument's automatic grid measured the distance between them in hundreds of miles. Pickering, aloft before them, had fled into the east and already was beginning to overtake them from the west. The ships were seen on the analog as two pips, two mites aloft in the air ocean."
1868,"""Aim for the heart,"" said Bearwarden to Ayrault. "" When you show me his ribs, I will follow you in the hole."" Ayrault instantly fired for a point just back of the left foreleg. The explosion had the same effect as on the mastodon, removing a half-barrel of hide, etc; and the next second Bearwarden sent a bullet less than an inch from where Ayrault's had stopped. [SNIPPET] The heroine of a modern novel is always “divinely tall,” and she is ever “drawing herself up to her full height.” At the “Barley Mow” she would bump her head against the ceiling each time she did this. It would also be a bad house for a drunken man to put up at. There are too many surprises in the way of unexpected steps down into this room and up into that; and as for getting upstairs to his bedroom, or ever finding his bed when he got up, either operation would be an utter impossibility to him. We were up early the next morning, as we wanted to be in Oxford by the afternoon. It is surprising how early one can get up, when camping out. One does not yearn for “just another five minutes” nearly so much, lying wrapped up in a rug on the boards of a boat, with a Gladstone bag for a pillow, as one does in a featherbed. We had finished breakfast, and were through Clifton Lock by half-past eight. From Clifton to Culham the river banks are flat, monotonous, and uninteresting, but, after you get through Culhalm Lock—the coldest and deepest lock on the river—the landscape improves."
1869,"Some day, my boy, you'll realize that you still have a lot to learn about handling men."" ""Yes, sir,"" I answered. Sara asked me if I were ready to start seeing people, and I told her I wasn't, that I had some thinking to do. She quipped something about making the world wait, meaning that I should be occupying my time with personnel managing, and closed the door. At that, Old Stone Face had a point. If he hadn't got in and riled things up, maybe the Swami would not have been emotionally upset enough to generate the psi force which had activated these new cylinders. [SNIPPET] Gamblers Anonymous."" He faded off down the dark street. The card merely said: ""Manhattan Chapter NO 5-5600"""
1870,"At this the two inspectors snorted with laughter. ""I might never have made it back to the base that night,"" said Frank, ignoring them, ""if a policeman hadn't come along and rapped me on the shoulder with his nightstick. I pretended to go, but I doubled around the corner and signaled I'd be back."" Frank spent all of his free time on Van Ness Avenue after that. ""It got so Elizabeth knew my schedules and expected me between flights. Once in a while if there was no one around we could whisper a few words to each other through the glass."" Frank paused, then said, ""As you know, gentlemen, we robots don't demand much out of activation. [SNIPPET] ""Yes,"" I laughed, not very true. ""I know what a craving can be. I shouldn't smoke, but I do. I've tried to stop but I lie there thinking about cigarettes half the night. Long ones, short ones, smoked ones, ones unlit. I feel like I could smoke one in each hand. It like that with you?"""
1871,"But the ornamental gadget at its top was not commonplace. It seemed to be a knob or a dial of some kind, divided into segments scored with vernier markings. I gazed at Pending askance. ""Well, Pat? [SNIPPET] Marden felt his jaw drop. ""Say, you sound, like you go in for that sort of thing! I'm telling you right now, I haven't enough cash on me to make it worth your while. I'm just a salesman, trying to get along."" ""You got nothin' to worry about,"" his passenger assured him. "" Stick-ups ain't my racket."" An audible sigh of relief escaped Marden. ""I'm certainly glad to hear that!"
1872,"Neither Science nor the gods can help or comfort in this awful world of Greatness! ""We stop. I hang motionless in the air. The ground beneath is utterly insane. But I see vast uncovered veins of rare metal—and crystal, precious crystal, enough to cover the mightiest Temple we could build! Oh, that Mortia were so blessed! In all this terrifying world, the richness of the crystal and the marvelous metal do redeem. ""Men!—--I see ... I believe it is a temple! [SNIPPET] You're an incompetent little fool. I should have fired you that first day. I've let you get away with so much only because you have a pretty face. You've only been on Earth a couple of months; how can you presume to think you know what's good and what's bad for the Fizbians here?"""
1873,"But it belongs to other little green people."" ""How do you feel about that?"" ""Well—I hate those giants!"" Trigger said. "" They're cruel. [SNIPPET] Suddenly Correy clutched my arm. ""Look!"" he whispered, ""Look!"" I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. I could see the water crawling inside the triangle formed by the three wisps of steam: crawling in white, foaming waves like tiny scraps of thread as it rushed headlong, in mighty tidal waves, away from the center of that triangle. The columns of steam flared up with fresh strength, darkening as though with smoke. Here and there within the triangle black specks appeared, grew larger, and ran together in crooked lines that widened continually."
1874,"Byng and Hawkes are dead. Come on—run, if you want to save yourself!"" [144] Alan sat very quietly in the empty apartment that had once belonged to Max Hawkes, and stared at nothing in particular. It was five hours since the abortive robbery. He was alone. The news had been blared out over every form of communication there was; he knew the story by heart. [SNIPPET] Laney nodded her head. "" There's no point arguing with him, Kanaday. He has to go back there and find out, so let him alone."" Rolf smiled. "" Thanks for understanding."" He took out Quinton's card and turned it over and over in his hand."
1875,"“I have just arrived,” he said, “and know nothing of the place. Have you been here long?”  “About two weeks,” I answered.  “Ah! [SNIPPET] For the news of these things had flown fast, and many of them were angry and some were doubtful. But Tristram came in very boldly, clad all in full armor, and when he stood in the midst of them he spoke loud and with great courage, saying: ""If there be any man here whom I have offended in any way, let him speak, and I will give him entire satisfaction whoever he may be. But let such speech be now or never, for here is my body to make good my knighthood against the body of any man, whomsoever he may be.""  At this all those knights who were there stood still and held their peace, and no man said anything against Sir Tristram (although there were several knights and lords who were kin to the Queen), for the boldness of Tristram overawed them, and no one had the heart to answer him.  So after a little while Sir Tristram left that place, without turning his head to see if any man followed him.  So he left that castle and Gouvernail went with him, and no one stopped him in his going. After that, he and Gouvernail came to the shore and took a boat and they came to the ship of Sir Tristram, and so they sailed away from Ireland. But the heart of Sir Tristram was so full of sorrow that he wished a great many times that he was dead."
1876,"He didn't see what happened because their apparent collision courses took them behind a giant building. Screamingly sweet blasts of sound surrounded them as they stopped for a red light. "" What the hell is going on here?"" said Barlow in a shrill, frightened voice, because the braking time was just about zero, he wasn't hurled against the dashboard. "" Who's kidding who?"" ""Why, what's the matter?"" demanded the driver. The light changed to green and he started the pickup. [SNIPPET] The titles come later. You can go now.""  The chief gave a pleased grin and collected his detail. The rather slight, youngish man who had something wrong with one arm was in charge—complete charge.  Grayson said: ""Mr. Folsom, you are relieved of the presidency. Captain, take him out and—"" He finished with a whimsical shrug. A portly four-striper took Folsom by one arm. Like a drugged man the deposed president let himself be led out.  Grayson looked around the table. """
1877,"William B. Hennessey paused. "" For centuries we have looked for leadership in our own midst and not found it. They were, after all, merely human. But now, into the hands of our noble scientists, has been imparted the great task of awakening the sleeping Great One, and when they have completed their work, the Golden Age of Earth will be upon us. ""I call upon you to throw off the shackles of despair. [SNIPPET] ""What?"" He looked at me as if he couldn't understand what might be bothering me, but I think perhaps he could. ""Nothing,"" I said, and that was that, except MacReidie was always a sourer man from that time up to as long as I knew him afterwards. We took off in the morning. The stoker had already left on the Jek ship, and it turned out he'd trained an apprentice boy to take his place. It was strange how things became different for us, little by little after that. It was never anything you could put your finger on, but the Jeks began taking more goods, and giving us things we needed when we told them we wanted them. After a while, Serenus was going a little deeper into Jek territory, and when she wore out, the two replacements let us trade with the Lud, too. Then it was the Nosurwey, and other people beyond them, and things just got better for us, somehow."
1878,"""Declarations by temporal transmission? Yes, of course. Routine transaction."" ""Take any money I have and use it to pay off the Hexers. Will you do it?"" ""I don't see why not, since our ancestor seems to approve."" Miss Tompkins regarded me solemnly. "" [SNIPPET] Johnny loved the little bear, and it was fun in the jungle, but he couldn't help wishing he were home. The waterfall was not much of a waterfall. A little way from the leopard's cave was a small spring high up in the rocks. A tiny stream of water fell about ten feet making a great spray and quite a little noise. It made a wonderful shower."
1879,"As expected the atmosphere proved to be thin. The speculated dead-sea areas, oddly enough, turned out to be just that. To the surprise of some, it was soon evident that Mars possessed, or had possessed, a high civilization. The canali of Schiaparelli were indeed broad waterways stretching from pole to pole, too regular to be anything but the work of intelligence. But most wonderful of all were the scattered, but fairly numerous large, walled cities that dotted the world. [SNIPPET] It had panicked him. He was fleeing dangerously now through the night, driven by a fear he did not know was in him. Inflexibility. This seemed to be the characteristic that marked Baker and his kind."
1880,"You must always help them. But they will always try to kill your mother and father. It is all mixed up."" ""Gee, Baba,"" Johnny was frowning now, too. "" C'mon, let's try the climb and forget it."" From one of the armor straps he unhooked a flashlight he always brought along for exploring caves. He fastened it to his belt. A few moments later the two friends were looking up at the bare rock face that extended three hundred feet straight up. ""Golly, Baba, do you really think you can take us up there?"" [SNIPPET] If Baba had been there they could have easily climbed up into the protection of the tree's leaves and branches. Luckily the brush was high and thick around it, screening them from view from the side. The tree itself screened off the sky. Once they had reached the trunk of the tree, they stood wordlessly for a while, breathing hard. ""Any idea where we are, Rick?"" Johnny asked in a whisper."
1881,"she asked.  “I didn’t notice it.”  She continued quickly to lay the table. When she had finished—  “Tea won’t be for a few minutes. [SNIPPET] she asked.  “Yes, but I’m not going to let him see it, and think I wanted him.”  Miriam was startled. She heard him putting his bicycle in the stable underneath, and talking to Jimmy, who had been a pit-horse, and who was seedy.  “Well, Jimmy my lad, how are ter? Nobbut sick an’ sadly, like? Why, then, it’s a shame, my owd lad.”"
1882,"Unhappy Mrs. Wadman! ——For nothing can make this chapter go off with spirit but an apostrophe to thee——but my heart tells me, that in such a crisis an apostrophe is but an insult in disguise, and ere I would offer one to a woman in distress—let the chapter go to the devil; provided any damn’d critic in keeping will be but at the trouble to take it with him.  [45] This must be a mistake in Mr. Shandy; for Graaf wrote upon the pancreatick juice, and the parts of generation. MYy uncle Toby’s Map is carried down into the kitchen. ——AND here is the Maes—and this is the Sambre; said the corporal, pointing with his right hand extended a little towards the map, and his left upon Mrs. Bridget’s shoulder—but not the shoulder next him—and this, said he, is the town of Namur—and this the citadel—and there lay the French—and here lay his honour and myself——and in this cursed trench, Mrs. Bridget, quoth the corporal, taking her by the hand, did he receive the wound which crush’d him so miserably here.——In pronouncing which, he slightly press’d the back of her hand towards the part he felt for——and let it fall. We thought, Mr. Trim, it had been more in the middle,——said Mrs. Bridget—— That would have undone us for ever—said the corporal. [SNIPPET] Let's see, what did I end with?—an M again—aye— I could have done it once."" "" Ah! evil betide you, and so you can now,"" said the other: ""nobody in this country will undertake you."" Adams could hold no longer: ""Friend,"" said he, ""I have a boy not above eight years old who would instruct thee that the last verse runs thus:—"
1883,"Where is it? It was a driving, promise-filled concept. No words; just the sense that something wonderful lay just beyond reach. But this voice was different from the manythoughts. It was directing his body; his mind was along for the ride. [SNIPPET] The hell with Gamine! For several minutes the road had been climbing, and now we topped the summit of a little rise and abruptly the trees came to an end. By tacit consent we all drew our horses to a walk. We stood atop the lip of a broad bowl of land, perhaps thirty miles across, filled to the brim with thick dark forest. Far out in this valley lay a cleared space, and in the center of that space lay a great tower; but not a slender and fairylike spire like the Towers of Rainbow City. This was a massive donjon thrusting heavy shoulders upward into the moon-washed sky. The Keep of the Dreamers. Something in me murmured, ""This is the forest where the Dreamer walks!""—or had the murmured voice come from Gamine, motionless behind me? Karamy rode eagerly, her face drawn tautly together, her slim tanned hands clenched on the reins."
1884,"But while I talked they separated distinctly as the bank of the stream and the chunk are suddenly not one, but two. ""It was not me alone. Every man in that room was doing the same. The ship itself was doing it—and suddenly ..."" ""Before anyone says something they might regret,"" Hugh Dunnam, the commander, said in a quiet warning voice, ""get this straight, all of you. This is a government ship. I'm an officer of the Earth Space Fleet and my command is law. [SNIPPET] Other glass tubes fastened on, to make the length almost ten feet. At one g the spring with its weight would stretch out to the bottom. From there to a ten thousandth of a g the spring rose up to a point half-way. Ren put it together speedily, placing it in the wall clamps designed to hold it."
1885,"Tears in the eyes. He lay very still, remembering. Curious how vividly it all came back, though the house had been ashes for nearly twenty years, and the girl—the girl . He rolled over violently, opening his eyes. No use remembering her. [SNIPPET] He gave up all outside activities in order to hasten the progress of his own knowledge. His wife, respecting Lambert's high order of devotion to his work, kept their two half-grown children from interfering during those long evenings when he studied and translated at home. Two evenings a week Lambert called on Vonk Poogla, the Argonaut assigned to Trade Coordination, and improved his conversational Argonian to the point where he could obtain additional historical information from the pink wide ""man."" Of the twelve thousand books, the number of special interest to Lambert were only one hundred and ten. On those he based his master chart. An animated film of the chart was prepared at Lambert's own expense, and, when it was done, he requested an appointment with Simpkin, Secretary for Stellar Affairs, going through all the normal channels to obtain the interview. He asked an hour of Simpkin's time. It took two weeks."
1886,"The bearded man stepped close to Miss Terry and put a hand on her shoulder. She recoiled as from a snake. "" How old are you?"" he asked. Miss Terry made some inarticulate squeaks and the man spoke more sharply. "" When were you born?"" ""Two thousand four,"" she managed to stutter. The bearded man considered this and shook his head. "" Over fifty. [SNIPPET] He swallowed against the dryness in his throat. ""You ... you're going to kill me,"" Pop said. It wasn't a question. Kane smiled, showing white teeth. ""I ... I know you are,"" Pop said unsteadily. """
1887,"Somewhere beneath its crushing weight lay the control board and the swarthy operator. Then they saw Solino, still in his overturned wheelchair, the cloak drawn tightly about himself and it; but the top of his head was crushed in like an eggshell. Justus Miles had touched that head when he stretched out his hand in the darkness. He and Ward had been saved from death as by a miracle. Over their heads the great piston had hurtled, killing Solino and tearing through the steel partition into the chamber beyond, visiting it with death and destruction. [SNIPPET] echoed Silby stupidly.  ""Yes. The damn stuff was growing. But it wasn't that which stampeded me out of there."
1888,"""The national party!"" I exclaimed. "" That must have arisen after my day. I suppose it was one of the labor parties.""  ""Oh no!"" replied the doctor. "" The labor parties, as such, never could have accomplished anything on a large or permanent scale. For purposes of national scope, their basis as merely class organizations was too narrow. It was not till a rearrangement of the industrial and social system on a higher ethical basis, and for the more efficient production of wealth, was recognized as the interest, not of one class, but equally of all classes, of rich and poor, cultured and ignorant, old and young, weak and strong, men and women, that there was any prospect that it would be achieved. [SNIPPET] Everything about him had grown dear, and there was almost a mule load of treasures and pets of his own collecting that could not be left behind. And when they had been carefully packed in panniers by Little John and one of the men, there was the task of bidding them all good-bye, and then those two words grew harder every time. But he spoke out manfully and well, in spite of a choking sensation, till nearly the last. ""For I'm coming back again,"" he said, ""and you'll take care of my pet fawn for me, Little John, and always remember to feed it well. And don't forget the dog and that dormouse we couldn't find, so that I can have it when I come back, and—"" Croak! What was that? It was a peculiar sound made up in the air by Little John, and that did it, for when young Robin looked up in astonishment, it was to see the great fellow's face all puckered up, and—yes, there were two great tears rolling down his cheeks as he caught the boy in his arms and kissed him. And so it was that when young Robin ran to bid Maid Marian good-bye, he could no longer hold it back."
1889,"""How about cameras?"" I asked him. "" Take a picture with a camera and it looks just about the same as a drawing, don't it?"" ""That's because cameras are built to take pictures like we're used to seeing them,"" he said. "" Flat, two-dimensional slices of reality, without depth or motion."" ""Even 3-D moving pictures?"" [SNIPPET] We'd get there before he does. Uh ... wouldn't we?"" ""Maybe. But he'll kill himself if he sees he's trapped."" That wasn't quite true. Bern was ready to fight to the death, and he had a heavy pistol to back him up. MacHeath didn't want to see anyone killed, and he didn't want stray bullets flying around the inside of that tube or in the target room. MacHeath and the FBI agent piled out of the elevator at the bottom of the shaft. Dr. Roger Kent was standing at the head of the stairs that spiraled down to the gun chamber."
1890,"After a while, the music stopped, but for a moment neither of them said anything. At last Channeljumper sighed. "" It's beautiful,"" he said. ""Yes,"" Longtree admitted. ""But—"" Channeljumper seemed puzzled—""but somehow it doesn't seem complete. Almost, but not quite. As though—as though—"" [SNIPPET] Or perhaps it is not so odd. Coffin-maker to the world, the American casket industry had by now almost completely automated box-making and gravedigging, with some interesting assembly lines and packaging arrangements; there still remained the jobs of management and distribution. The President of General Mortuary, an ebullient fellow affectionately called Sarcophagus Sam, put it well. "" As long as I have a single prospective customer, and a single Stockholder,"" he said, mangling a stogie and beetling his brows at the one reporter who'd showed up for the press conference, ""I'll try to put him in a coffin so I can pay him a dividend."""
1891,"""That is curious! But as I remember, they were a people of elastic honor."" ""They were so considered,"" said Nōfūhl; ""their commercial honor was a jest. They were sharper than the Turks. Prosperity was their god, with cunning and invention for his prophets. Their restless activity no Persian can comprehend. This vast country was alive with noisy industries, the nervous Mehrikans darting with inconceivable rapidity from one city to another by a system of locomotion we can only guess at. [SNIPPET] If he says he has a great auk, you may be satisfied he has."" My heart was beating with excitement at the prospect; I looked out across the wooded headlands and tangled stretches of dune and hollow, trying to realize what it might mean to me, to Professor Farrago, to the world, if I should lead back to New York a live auk. ""He's a crank,"" said Lee; ""frankly, I don't like him. If you find it unpleasant there, come back to us."" ""Does Halyard live alone?"" I asked. ""Yes—except for a professional trained nurse—poor thing!"" ""A man?"" ""No,"" said Lee, disgustedly."
1892,"She squeezed up close to me, so that our knees were touching. "" I believe in you. I've told you that I have seen you predict the future. More than that, I have felt you cure me. But precognition is hard to prove, and if we are going to get you into the Lodge, I think we had better stick to Maragon's advice and work on your healing powers. It's Maragon you'll have to convince. He's the last word."" [SNIPPET] But faced with something which would prove definitely— Well, what would he do now? And then I noticed that both cylinders were pointing toward the door. I watched them, at first, not quite sure; then I grew convinced by the change in their perspective with the angles of the desk. Almost as slowly as the minute hand of a watch, they were creeping across the desk toward the door. They, too, were trying to escape from the room."
1893,"I'm—I committed suicide. That's how drunk I was. There hasn't been a suicide in the Miller family in centuries. It took a skinful of liquor to set the precedent."" Erickson nodded wisely. "" [SNIPPET] Aloud she snapped: ""Family album, indeed! What I'm after is to get permission for this child to have a pet. I'm positive it would make all the difference in the world to him."" ""You won't get permission, nurse. Mrs. Frank won't have any other pets around to bother precious Kiki,"" he said grimly. ""Not if it's a matter of life or death?"" she persisted."
1894,"I said as much to him. I stood there in his laboratory, leaned up against a work bench, and risked burning an acid hole in the sleeve of my jacket just to put over an air of unconcern. He was perched on the edge of an opposite work bench, swinging his feet, and hiding the expression in his eyes behind the window's reflection upon his polished glasses. I said even more. ""You know,"" I said reflectively, ""I'm completely unable to understand the attitude of supposedly unbiased men of science. Now you take all that mass of data about psi effects, the odd and unexplainable happenings, the premonitions, the specific predictions, the accurate descriptions of far away simultaneously happening events. You take that whole mountainous mass of data, evidence, phenomena—"" A slight turn of his head gave me a glimpse of his eyes behind the glasses. [SNIPPET] He climbed out of the car, and with another nod the orderly drove it back to the E building. Henceforward the ship's crew would be the E's orderlies. Cal climbed the short ramp and entered the ship. ""You have clearance to take off at once?"" he asked Lynwood. Lynwood nodded. "" Since early morning,"" he answered."
1895,"Yes, and I will do more for you, Nais, since this day brings me to a husband. Seeing that all your estate is confiscate as a penalty for your late rebellion, I will charge myself with your dowry, and give it back to you. So come, name me the man.”  The girl looked at her with a sullen brow. “ I spoke a lie,” she said; “there is no man.”  I tried myself to give her advocacy. “ [SNIPPET] The newcomer looked at him for a second, and then broke into a great, roaring guffaw. He thumped Faull on the back playfully—but the play was rather rough, for the victim was sent staggering against the wall before he could recover his balance.  “Good evening, my host!”  “And good evening to you too, my lad!” he went on, addressing the supernatural youth, who was now beginning to wander about the room, in apparent unconsciousness of his surroundings. “ I have seen someone very like you before, I think.”"
1896,"She had said it, and now she was armored against everything. ""No,"" her father was saying dully. "" No, Joyce. No."" ""I'm sorry, Dad,"" she said all in a rush. "" I've thought about it a long time. [SNIPPET] Next bets!"" The spheres had come to rest with Pluto near one end of a lavender spiral and Mercury touching the inner end, but no one had had the insanity to bet that way. Meadows began to play inner planet combinations that occasionally paid, though at short odds. He made a bit on some near misses, and I decided to have a drink while he lost it. I found Howlet, Konnel, and Lilac Malone in the bar admiring the red-bronze landscape. When he heard about Meadows, Howlet smiled. ""If it isn't fixed, they better prepare to abandon,"" he laughed. """
1897,"Let me see who dares touch—"" Here he stopped of a sudden, for his words choked him. At last he said, in a deep, husky voice, ""Now, if aught of harm befalls thee because of this day's doings, I swear by Saint George that the red cock shall crow over the rooftree of this house, for the hot flames shall lick every crack and cranny thereof. As for these women""—here he ground his teeth—""it will be an ill day for them!""  But Robin Hood took Little John's rough, brown fist in his white hands, and chid him softly in his low, weak voice, asking him since what time Little John had thought of doing harm to women, even in vengeance. Thus he talked till, at last, the other promised, in a choking voice, that no ill should fall upon the place, no matter what happened. [SNIPPET] WALTON'S HEALTH RESORTS OF THE GOBI AND SHAMO. 3s. 6d. WALTON'S THE POLE AND PULMONARY COMPLAINTS. 7s."
1898,"every 6 hours. 1 ten-mile walk every morning. 1 bed at 11 sharp every night. And don’t stuff up your head with things you don’t understand.” [SNIPPET] My goodness! What a FOOL I have been!” he whispered, and then darted swiftly across the shadowy landing into the empty bedroom from which he had just come. He stood listening—quivering. The footsteps reached the first-floor landing."
1899,"""Any difficulty?"" Eo asked as the machines dumped Patrolman Whedbee on the table. ""The language was the greatest obstacle,"" Za said. "" The same word has many different meanings, or many different words have the same meaning. Rather crude."" ""Did you use bait, or force?"" ""Bait,"" Za said. "" [SNIPPET] Therefore we are counter-attacking!"" Worn out by his attacking and mixed metaphors, the Admiral mopped his brow. ""Our laboratories have been working night and day on the perfection of a device we hoped we would never be forced to use. It is now in operation, having passed the final trials a few days ago."
1900,"Apparently the light of the suns kept the Dragons away. ragons. That was what people called them. To ordinary people, there was nothing, nothing except the shiver of planoforming and the hammer blow of sudden death or the dark spastic note of lunacy descending into their minds. But to the telepaths, they were Dragons. In the fraction of a second between the telepaths' awareness of a hostile something out in the black, hollow nothingness of space and the impact of a ferocious, ruinous psychic blow against all living things within the ship, the telepaths had sensed entities something like the Dragons of ancient human lore, beasts more clever than beasts, demons more tangible than demons, hungry vortices of aliveness and hate compounded by unknown means out of the thin tenuous matter between the stars. It took a surviving ship to bring back the news—a ship in which, by sheer chance, a telepath had a light beam ready, turning it out at the innocent dust so that, within the panorama of his mind, the Dragon dissolved into nothing at all and the other passengers, themselves non-telepathic, went about their way not realizing that their own immediate deaths had been averted. [SNIPPET] Menesee ordered the man sharply. He returned his attention to the center of the hall as Spokesman Dorn announced in a voice which held more of an edge than was normal but had lost none of its strength and steadiness, ""Before any moves are suggested, I shall tell you what has been done. ""The Tribunal Hall has been sealed and further events in it will be monitored from without. No one will be able to leave until the matter with which we are now concerned here has been settled to the satisfaction of the Machine."
1901,"Nor was it a small concession. The hand-gisarm had been a weapon very much in vogue in King Richard's day, and was now nearly if not entirely out of fashion with the younger generation of warriors. The Earl of Alban was, of course, well used to the blade; with Myles it was strange and new, either for attack or in defence.  With the administration of the final oath and the examination of the weapons, the preliminary ceremonies came to an end, and presently Myles heard the criers calling to clear the lists. As those around him moved to withdraw, the young knight drew off his mailed gauntlet, and gave Gascoyne's hand one last final clasp, strong, earnest, and intense with the close friendship of young manhood, and poor Gascoyne looked up at him with a face ghastly white.  Then all were gone; the gates of the principal list and that of the false list were closed clashing, and Myles was alone, face to face, with his mortal enemy.    There was a little while of restless, rustling silence, during which the Constable took his place in the seat appointed for him directly in front of and below the King's throne. [SNIPPET] The men gasped and the spasmodic oaths that came from them were born of incredulity. It was plain that they doubted their ears.  ""Say it ag'in,"" muttered Bill, in bewildered tones.  ""He's stringin' us, Bill,"" said the other.  ""Sure,"" growled Bill. "" It's a nice way to treat us, mister."
1902,"The launching was made from a site in Thibet. Naturally, my Government cannot deviate from our present just and reasonable attitude in the Khakum River question. Trusting that your Government will realize this, I have the honor to be, Your obedient and respectful servant, [SNIPPET] If I jumped, they jumped. In order to make the connection to my body, the manufacturers removed my coccyx and plugged in at and around the end of my spinal column. In other words, I had a very long and rather flexible tail, at the end of which was a smoothly streamlined flesh-colored box that followed me around on its own two legs. A human has certain normally atrophied muscles for control of his usually non-existent tail. Through surgery and training, those muscles became my voluntary controllers for my tail and the cart. That is, I could go around waggin' my tail while draggin' my wagon. Pardon me, Miss Dix VI."
1903,"You are angels, both of you.”  “No. Let me alone,” cried the Countess shaking off the hand that her father had laid on her arm. “ She is more merciless than my husband. [SNIPPET] In the same moment I saw her running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about her, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.  I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat. That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over her; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,—that this occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded bridal dress.  Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or why we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.  She was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even touched."
1904,"Suddenly the gipsy band turned and fled into the brushwood on the lower slopes. Breathless, Felix sat down on the knoll, and the spearmen swarmed around him. Hardly had they begun to speak to him than there was a shout, and they saw a body of shepherds descending the hill. There were three hundred of them; warned by the messenger, the whole country had risen to repel the gipsies. Too late to join in the fight, they had seen the last of it. They examined the field. There were ten dead and six wounded, who were taken prisoners; the rest escaped, though hurt. [SNIPPET] There was a deep and narrow valley like a groove or green trench opening to the south. At the upper end of the valley rose a hill, not very high, but steep, narrow at the ridge, and steep again on the other side. Over it was a broad, wooded, and beautiful vale; beyond that again the higher mountains. Towards the foot of the narrow ridge here, there was a succession of chalk cliffs, so that to climb up on that side in the face of opposition would be extremely difficult. In the gorge of the enclosed narrow valley a spring rose. The shepherds had formed eight pools, one after the other, water being of great importance to them; and farther down, where the valley opened, there were forty or fifty acres of irrigated meadow. The spring then ran into a considerable brook, across which was the forest. Felix's idea was to run a palisade along the margin of the brook, and up both sides of the valley to the ridge."
1905,"""Then stop sounding off and listen to us!"" snapped Peter. "" I charge the Empire of Xanabar with the crime of being indifferent to the welfare of the stranger within her gate. I charge kidnaping and attempted murder, and I charge the latter against the specimen you hold in your hand."" [SNIPPET] With the self-sealing lock of the same resistant material, a mere pounding was nothing. Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway. He went up the steel ladder leading to the station's power plant and the televisor that could look into every room within the station. He heaved a slight sigh when he reached the power room, for right at his hand were weapons to blast the ship from the asteroid. Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the lock to the station. His teeth suddenly clamped down on his lower lip. Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes into the stelrylite with round-headed metal clubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't break up that easily."
1906,"Bradley had now succeeded in wrestling his arm free from von Schoenvorts' grip and in dropping the latter with a blow from the butt of his pistol. The rest of the English and Germans were engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter, Plesser and Hindle standing aside from the melee and urging their comrades to surrender and join with the English against the tyranny of von Schoenvorts. Heinz and Klatz, possibly influenced by their exhortation, were putting up but a half-hearted resistance; but Dietz, a huge, bearded, bull-necked Prussian, yelling like a maniac, sought to exterminate the Englische schweinhunde with his bayonet, fearing to fire his piece lest he kill some of his comrades.  It was Olson who engaged him, and though unused to the long German rifle and bayonet, he met the bull-rush of the Hun with the cold, cruel precision and science of English bayonet-fighting. [SNIPPET] They watched in amazement as the swift aerial steed flapped its way after the rising ovoids. And then the savage let loose an end of his thong and released its missile, which crashed full against the transparent disk of an ovoid and tore its way through. The damaged ovoid careened violently and then fell end over end, crashing in the forest. With a bellow of fury, Mado fired with the kalbite tube at his hip."
1907,"""Horrible?"" he repeated. "" I see nothing horrible about that. The rykors are but brainless flesh. They neither see, nor feel, nor hear. They can scarce move but for us. If we did not bring them food they would starve to death. [SNIPPET] The confusion, the contradictory babel of voices, dies away into order and silence, and, as Constans had foreseen, his orders were to suspend operations on the portcullis and proceed with all speed to the blocking-up of the archway. Choked to the ceiling with loose stones and other débris, it would be a formidable barricade to carry by assault. Constans strode up and down the room, devoured by impatience. Piers Minor had been gone now upward of half an hour, and yet there was no sign of preparation in the camp of the allies. It would take possibly an hour longer to make the vaulted passage impassable; Piers Major must advance within half that time if he would take advantage of this secret weakness in the defence. Failing to do so, he would be thrown back upon the desperate adventure of the scaling-ladders, and the whole issue would then hang upon the effectiveness with which Constans could bring off his attack from the rear. The restless fit passed, and Constans leaned out upon[Pg 245] the window-sill, watching the darkening sky. A fierce revulsion seized him as he pictured to himself the scene upon which the morning sun would look—the kennels red with blood, the horrors huddled in every corner, all the dreadful jetsam cast up by the ensanguined tide of war."
1908,"Charles' outlook was quite different. ""What do you think of girls?"" Mark would ask, sitting on a packing case outside the shack, after the chores were done. ""Oh, I don't know. You have to find the right one."" The robot would reply dutifully, repeating what had been put on its tape. ""I never saw a good one yet,"" Mark would say. [SNIPPET] ""Check-up time, I suppose,"" muttered Gaines without looking up from the magazine he held propped on his knees. He finished the paragraph, snapped the magazine shut, and swung his legs down from the railing that ran along in front of the data board. "" Dirty work for white-collar men like us."" Sokolski snorted. "" You haven't worn a white shirt in the last six years,"" he growled, rising and going to the supply closet. He swung open the door and began pulling out equipment. """
1909,"He thought back to his first look at the cloud of fragments. There had been nothing between his shield and the jammer. The only remaining possibility, then, was that the warhead was being hidden from him by the jammer itself. He would have to look on the other side of the jammer, using the ship itself as a shield. He swung out from behind the shielding fragment, and saw his radar images blotted out. He switched off the radar, and aimed the ship slightly to one side of the infrared image of the jammer. [SNIPPET] Do you have any explanation?"" ""No, sir,"" I said. ""Don't let it happen again. On this ship we are prompt."" ""Aye, sir,"" I muttered."
1910,"Increasingly aware of her own weakness, [Pg 84]she constantly attempted to lead the conversation into impersonal channels, speaking preferably of his work. ""Tell me,"" she said, negligently fanning herself, ""what new inspiration have you drawn from your stay at the seaside?"" ""Why,"" he exclaimed enthusiastically, ""volumes and volumes of it. I shall write the great novel of my life after I am once more quietly installed at Riverside Drive."" ""The great American novel?"" she rejoined. ""Perhaps."" ""Who will be your hero—Clarke?"" [SNIPPET] Taking the disk of blue plastic from his packet, he handed it to the clerk at the desk, who dropped it into a slot in the voder in front of him. Instantly, a mechanical voice responded: ""Verkan Vall, blue-seal noble, hereditary Mavrad of Nerros. Special Chief's Assistant, Paratime Police, special assignment."
1911,"For instance, the cars are as you know, run on the principle of the monorail with a guiding rail on each side. The grooves for the rails with their three rollers are in each car. There is a slight leakage of air here."" ""You used the turbo type of blower, didn't you?"" ""Had to because of the noise. We put some silencing devices on that and yet we could not kill all of the racket. [SNIPPET] There were also fanatical nationalist groups in Europe, both sides of the Iron Curtain, who might have thought our mutual destruction would be worth the risks involved."" ""There was China, and India. If your country and mine wiped each other out, they could go back to the old ways and the old traditions. Or Japan, or the Moslem States. In the end, they all went down along with us, but what criminal ever expects to fall?"" ""We have too many suspects, and the trail's too cold, Alexis. That rocket wouldn't have had to have been launched anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere. For instance, our friends here in the Argentine have been doing very well by themselves since El Coloso del Norte went down."""
1912,"The force of the unicorn's charge took it past her but its legs collapsed under it and it crashed to the ground, sliding a little way before it stopped. It kicked once and lay still. She went to it, to retrieve her spear, and even from the distance there was an air of pride about her as she walked past her bulky victim. Then she saw the book, knocked to one side by the unicorn's hooves. Tatters of its pages were blowing in the wind and she stiffened, her face growing pale. She ran to it to pick it up, the unicorn forgotten. She was trying to smooth the torn leaves when he reached her. It had been one of the old textbooks, printed on real paper, and it was fragile with age. [SNIPPET] As he fell, a fat white hand darted over the table toward the oblong of folded, yellow paper lying unprotected on its surface. Penrun clutched at it frantically. The fat fingers closed on the paper and were gone. Penrun whirled about. The drapes of the doorway framed a heavy, pasty face with liquid black eyes. The slug gun was aiming again, this time at Penrun."
1913,"How much?  Porter. Sixpence.  Nora. [SNIPPET] When that is over, we may expect them back.  Krogstad. Yes, yes—I will go. But it is all no use. Of course you are not aware what steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.  Mrs. Linde. Yes, I know all about that.  Krogstad."
1914,"Any moment now, the robots would begin their mindless worship. She shuddered and turned to escape. But something held her. She crept instead, step by soundless step, toward the source of that exquisite music. [SNIPPET] ""I'd come home intending to--tell them there was no Brain, tell them to stop wasting their time hunting for it and start trying to figure out the answers themselves. But I couldn't. They don't believe in the Brain as a tool, to use; it's a machine god that they can bring all their troubles to. You can't take a thing like that away from people without giving them something better."" ""I noticed you suggested building a spaceship and agreed with the professor about building a computer. What was your idea? To take their minds off hunting for the Brain and keep them busy?"" Conn shook his head. "" I'm serious about the ship--ships."
1915,"The Explorer XII is the greatest bird they ever built. Nothing short of a direct meteorite hit can hurt it, and the odds are a million to one . Why don't they leave the stars alone? Why don't they leave the stars to God? The afternoon shadows lengthened on the lawn and the sun grew red and swollen over the western hills. [SNIPPET] A head popped out of the door at the far end of the corridor. ""Guz! Hurry, Guz!"" De Hooch didn't bother to answer Willows."
1916,"Maybe you can explain a few things."" Ren grinned crookedly. ""Suppose I do the explaining over something to eat,"" he said. "" I almost stopped and had something on the way over here, but I wanted to wait and eat with you. Do you mind?"" ""Of course not,"" Martha frowned. She was taking a closer look at this spaceman second class. [SNIPPET] A human being is not. In some inexplicable way, however, I was becoming more and more like the drop of water after it is dropped into a large volume of water. I was 'spreading', while all the time seeming to be just my normal self. ""I think I was beginning dimly to see the new metaphysical basics that were to make the whole thing sensible and manipulable. At least, I had already realized that it was different than would be, for example, the difference in operational principle of a gas engine and an electric transformer. ""If you've ever studied any abstract mathematical system you'll be able to understand how the changing of one basic axiom can alter the whole structure almost beyond recognition."
1917,"Haven't I got feelings?"" Henry strode around the room, hitting the fibroid floor like a prehistoric monster on a sandpaper bridge. "" Either that picture goes,"" he said finally, definitely, ""or I go!"" Phoebe shook out her blonde hair, letting it fall about her shoulders. "" Too bad."" Inside of an hour he had packed his suitcases. Phoebe cried bitterly, but wouldn't budge about the picture. Henry took the plane. He put up at his club, went to the bar, and was gobbling down something called pressurized scotch, when he heard a noise back of him. [SNIPPET] And would there be more than speaking to do? I did not think there was much I could do but speak. Charpantier lacks a finger, but I ... I have hands, but I lack them. Oh, but the stars were cold! The Moon in this season was a day Moon, and now below the horizon. Stars, stars and galaxies, but beyond them, where the Veldish beings lived, nothing I could see, and below the stars, too, here where I reached the brow of the hill and clumsily opened my wings, here, too, nothing, as I lurched into the night and in great strain beat toward the places of men."
1918,"""We won't need them!"" yelled Jeter. "" There isn't time. Let's go!"" Jeter was away at top speed, almost pulling Eyer off his feet because their hands were still fastened together with the handcuffs. They were outside on the floor level. And through many doors denizens of the lower control room, hurried out by the commands of Sitsumi, were racing to head them off. But nothing could stop them. One man got in their way and Eyer's right fist caved in his face with one deadly, devastating blow. [SNIPPET] Hunter drew his blaster and entered the thickly-carpeted hall, glowing with the soft, pink light of the luminous, Martian stone. He cried Ann's name. His voice fell hollowly in the silence, but there was no response. He moved to the end of the hall and pushed open a narrow door. He saw the white-tiled laboratory, Ann's transmitter standing on a long table with new platinum grids piled by the dozen beside it, and the barrack rows of hospital beds."
1919,"Funniest thing I ever saw. The road to Mount Lemmon's blocked. My family,"" he said inconsequentially, ""is at Mount Lemmon for the summer and I want to get through to them.""  Blocked! The crowd stared at him wonderingly. John Redpath threw in his clutch. "" So long,"" he said. "" I've a brother in Tucson, and I'm going to his place until this blows over.""  As he left Oracle, John Redpath noticed several dark globes drifting down on it from the hills. [SNIPPET] He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race. But he broke their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a man has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take away from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right of man, and there is no right on earth above this right. And he stood on the threshold of the freedom for which the blood of the centuries behind him had been spilled.  But then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his savage beginning.  What brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away from men?"
1920,"But the air defied her; she was deaf, blind, insensate; she was cut off irrevocably from this higher level of communication. Perhaps their children. ""He is saying the words now,"" Gregrill whispered in her ear. "" You two together ... comfort each other ... against the darkness and the drought ... through the long dry misery of winter ... when the water is locked and nothing grows ... till the glad day of rain and running streams ... you two together ... comfort each other...."" ""Say yes, my darling,"" Gregrill told her. [SNIPPET] It was he! He had made the two-hundred-mile trip to meet her! She began to run. She stumbled, caught herself on somebody's arm, ran again, plunged against him, lost herself against his big, powerful chest. ""Oh, Greg! Greg, you're here!"" It was a long while before she could pull herself away to look at him. She had forgotten his strength, the magnificent arch of his chest. He was wearing a white fiber vest in the traditional style, sleeveless, cut low in front."
1921,"""Courage!"" she said, and he smiled back at her. There was the shining of the river; now they could see the pier and the boats of the shad-fishers lying alongside. Piers Minor cast off the largest and most seaworthy-looking of the lot, and, without troubling to bail out the standing water, he brought the craft broadside to the wharf and held out his hand to Nanna. But she, looking to the northward, where the gilded cupola of Arcadia House shone out against the sky, neither moved nor spoke. ""Come,"" he said.[Pg 272] The girl turned. "" She is there,"" she said, and pointed to the north. "" I must go to her—my little sister."" [SNIPPET] so miserable, so miserable and tired—tired. The rustle of the paper, tries my brain. My hearing seems preternaturally sharp. I will sit awhile and think. ""Hush! I hear something, down—down in the cellars. It is a creaking sound."
1922,"""I know just the thing,"" Porteous said happily. "" Here."" He dipped into the glittering litter on the tray and handed Harry Junior a translucent prism. "" A neural distorter. We use it to train regressives on Rigel Two. It might be of assistance."" [SNIPPET] ""Rest is nature's finest tonic,"" said Loveral, and hearing his voice thought suddenly there was hardly anything he could say any more that might not sound a bit out of place in this peaceful world. Rest to the man who had nothing to do ceased to be a tonic. ""Yes, yes,"" said Loveral. "" May we just sit down, my dear?"" Mrs. Atkinson jerked a hand toward one of the chairs and then wound her fingers."
1923,"Trusting that your Government will realize this, I have the honor to be, Your obedient and respectful servant, Wu Fung T     From N. Y. TIMES, Feb. 20, 1984: AFGHAN RULER FETED AT N Ameer Shere Ali Abdallah C [SNIPPET] He had really grown to respect the marva. ""They have learned to live with other creatures, and have taught all their friends, as they call the animals, to live in peace together. The meat eaters have their meat trees so they don't need to attack other animals—it's amazing,"" Rick reported. Johnny remembered how Baba had preened himself when Rick had spoken that way, and he smiled. ""Hey, Baba,"" Johnny said, ""how soon do you think we could take a trip all around the groves? We could get Skorkin to carry us, and go visit everybody."" ""You will have to come stay with my people,"" Baba said. Only a few days before Baba had discovered a host of aunts, uncles and cousins in one of the outlying groves."
1924,"I'd like to hear anybody try. Just once, that's all! I bet they'd never try it ag——OUCH!”  “Why? What'd you do to 'em?” [SNIPPET] After saluting us the bo'sun called out to the second mate that he would tow us round to the far side of the island, and to this the officer agreed, being, I surmised, by no means sorry to put some solid matter between himself and the desolation of the great weed-continent; and so, having loosed the hawser, which fell from the hill-top with a prodigious splash, we had the boat head, towing. In this wise we opened out, presently, the end of the hill; but feeling now the force of the breeze, we bent a kedge to the hawser, and, the bo'sun carrying it seawards, we warped ourselves to windward of the island, and here, in forty fathoms, we vast heaving, and rode to the kedge. Now when this was accomplished they called to our men to come aboard, and this they did, and spent all of that day in talk and eating; for those in the ship could scarce make enough of our fellows. And then, when it had come to night, they replaced that part of the superstructure which they had removed from about the head of the mizzen-stump, and so, all being secure, each one turned-in and had a full night's rest, of the which, indeed, many of them stood in sore need."
1925,"That evening he had the peculiar light in the eyes and the unusual vivacity which had been once noticed in him by Mr. Farebrother. The exceptional fact of his presence was much noticed in the room, where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company; and several lookers-on, as well as some of the players, were betting with animation. Lydgate was playing well, and felt confident; the bets were dropping round him, and with a swift glancing thought of the probable gain which might double the sum he was saving from his horse, he began to bet on his own play, and won again and again. Mr. Bambridge had come in, but Lydgate did not notice him. He was not only excited with his play, but visions were gleaming on him of going the next day to Brassing, where there was gambling on a grander scale to be had, and where, by one powerful snatch at the devil’s bait, he might carry it off without the hook, and buy his rescue from his daily solicitings. [SNIPPET] “It’s wonderful how close poor Peter was,” she said, in the same undertones. “ We none of us know what he might have had on his mind. I only hope and trust he wasn’t a worse liver than we think of, Martha.”  Poor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had the additional motive for making her remarks unexceptionable and giving them a general bearing, that even her whispers were loud and liable to sudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ.  “I never was covetous, Jane,” she replied; “but I have six children and have buried three, and I didn’t marry into money. The eldest, that sits there, is but nineteen—so I leave you to guess."
1926,"They'd have made mincemeat of us."" ""No,"" replied Edmund, sorrowfully shaking his head, ""it wasn't necessary. The noise would have sufficed; and I ought to have known it."" ""Why didn't you shout, then? [SNIPPET] There was no answer, and Constans felt that the hand that lay in his was growing cold. Then for one brief instant the soul looked out from the hollowed eyes. ""The sun!"" he said, and smiled as one who, having kept the watches of a long night, looks upon the dawn. "" The sun!"""
1927,"And what the hell, the doctors are increasing our lifespan every day with new drugs and things, aren't they? Sure. But perhaps we'd live to be about a thousand, if the slizzers left us alone. Ever stop to think how little we know about why we live? . [SNIPPET] A Peter W. Merrill Moonplant, of course! They looked down in rapture as meteor after meteor—drawn across the countless miles of space by the pulsating gravity fields, plunged into the Earth, leaving pocks visible to the naked moondweller's eye. And darned if each meteor didn't strike dead center of each plant network. After about a month, Earth looked almost exactly like the moon had once looked, with the exception of one locale: Australia, and much of the Pacific Ocean surrounding it. ""It will indeed be a titanic meteor that hits there!"" the moon scientists enthused. For their careful check of the records showed that only one plant had been found on the whole continent of Australia, toward the eastern coast; which meant that its network probably extended beneath the Pacific itself, with a gigantic field reaching its hungry magnetic fingers into space."
1928,"Here, let me grab you a taxi."" Reaction sets in a bit and your knees begin to buckle, but you shake your head and come up for air. ""I—I left my money home,"" you begin. The cop nods. "" Oh, that explains it. Fine, I won't have to give you an appearance schedule. But you should have come to me."" He reaches out and taps a pedestrian lightly on the shoulder. "" Sir, an emergency request. [SNIPPET] Well, you better believe it, because here I am."" ""Must be some clerical error,"" Gunderson said. ""Let's change the subject,"" Preston snapped. They were silent for a few moments, as the three ships—two armed, one loaded with mail for Ganymede—streaked outward away from Earth. Manipulating his controls with the ease of long experience, Preston guided the ship smoothly toward the gleaming bulk of far-off Jupiter. Even at this distance, he could see five or six bright pips surrounding the huge planet. There was Callisto, and—ah—there was Ganymede. He made computations, checked his controls, figured orbits. Anything to keep from having to talk to his two ex-Patrolmates or from having to think about the humiliating job he was on."
1929,"But you're different, Colin. I'm excited; I want to talk to somebody about it."" ""Sure,"" he said. "" You had a session already?"" ""Yes, my first was today. It's a funny place to do research—Kennedy's got a big suite on Fifth Avenue, right up in the classy district. [SNIPPET] He pointed at several of the other drawings. They left the message in the tower, and Arcot closed the door, leaving the pyramid exactly as it had been before they had come. ""Say!"" Morey commented, ""how did you open and close that door, anyway?"" Arcot grinned. "" Didn't you notice the jewel at the corner? It was the lens of a photoelectric cell. My flashlight opened the door."
1930,"The concentration that he gave to this inordinate progress through countries of which history is ignorant and cities so fantastic in their bulwarks that, though their inhabitants were human, yet the foe that they feared seemed something less or more; the amazement with which he beheld gates and towers unknown even to art, and furtive people thronging intricate ways to acclaim him as their sovereign—all these things began to affect his capacity for Business. He knew as well as any that his fancy could not rule these beautiful lands unless that other Shap, however unimportant, were well sheltered and fed: and shelter and food meant money, and money, Business. His was more like the mistake of some gambler with cunning schemes who overlooks human greed. One day his fancy, riding in the morning, came to a city gorgeous as the sunrise, in whose opalescent wall were gates of gold, so huge that a river poured between the bars, floating in, when the gates were opened, large galleons under sail. [SNIPPET] This last to the dead Wieroo as he stooped and dragged the corpse to the central shaft, where he raised it to the aperture and let it slip into the tube. Then he picked up the head and tossed it after the body. "" Don't be so glum,"" he admonished the former as he carried it toward the well; ""smile!""  ""But how can he smile?"" questioned the girl, a half-puzzled, half-frightened look upon her face. "" He is dead.""  ""That's so,"" admitted Bradley, ""and I suppose he does feel a bit cut up about it.""  The girl shook her head and edged away from the man—toward the door."
1931,"And still beyond, as I shaded my eyes, I could see swimming in the black a speck with the unmistakable glow of reflected light. With both gravity projectors in readiness, we pulled out of our orbit and straight across toward[Pg 302] the planet, letting the attraction of Rigel fight against our still tremendous speed. For a while, the pull of the big star was almost overpowering. Then we got past, and into the gravitational field of the planet. We spiralled down around it, looking for a landing place and trying to match our speed with its rotational velocity. From rather unreliable observations, the planet seemed a good deal smaller than the moon, and yet so dense as to have a greater gravitational attraction. [SNIPPET] He had been born for a wilder age, when men took what they wanted and held what they could without respect for law. Obedience was not in him, and so— As vividly as on that day it happened he felt the same old surge of anger and despair twenty years old now, felt the ray-gun bucking hard against his unaccustomed fist, heard the hiss of its deadly charge ravening into a face he hated. He could not be sorry, even now, for that first man he had killed. But in the smoke of that killing had gone up the columned house and the future he might have had, the boy himself—lost as Atlantis now—and the girl with the honey-colored hair and much, much else besides. It had to happen, he knew. He being the boy he was, it had to happen. Even if he could go back and start all over, the tale would be the same. And it was all long past now, anyhow; and nobody remembered any more at all, except himself."
1932,"""That must have made headlines,"" Dudley commented. ""Sure did."" Fisher had the cigar going, now, and he puffed economically upon it. "" Especially when she ran away from home."" ""Oh?"" Dudley felt it coming. "" Where to?"" ""Here!"" Fisher held his cigar between thumb and forefinger and examined it fondly. [SNIPPET] Then he found Johnny, at the foot of a high cliff. He was dead, his neck broken by the fall. Scattered all around him from the torn sack was the food he had wanted to give to the cats. He buried Johnny the next day, while a cold wind moaned under a lead-gray sky."
1933,"With bright beady eyes they glanced shyly at each other, sniggering a little, sniffing and applying coat-sleeves a good deal. As the door opened, one of the elder ones that carried the lantern was just saying, “Now then, one, two, three!” and forthwith their shrill little voices uprose on the air, singing one of the old-time carols that their forefathers composed in fields that were fallow and held by frost, or when snow-bound in chimney corners, and handed down to be sung in the miry street to lamp-lit windows at Yule-time.  CAROL Villagers all, this frosty tide, Let your doors swing open wide, Though wind may follow, and snow beside, Yet draw us in by your fire to bide; Joy shall be yours in the morning! Here we stand in the cold and the sleet, Blowing fingers and stamping feet, Come from far away you to greet— You by the fire and we in the street— Bidding you joy in the morning! [SNIPPET] “Don’t pretend to be stupider than you really are,” replied the Badger, crossly; “and don’t chuckle and splutter in your coffee while you’re talking; it’s not manners. What I mean is, the Banquet will be at night, of course, but the invitations will have to be written and got off at once, and you’ve got to write ’em. Now, sit down at that table—there’s stacks of letter-paper on it, with ‘Toad Hall’ at the top in blue and gold—and write invitations to all our friends, and if you stick to it we shall get them out before luncheon. And I’ll bear a hand, too; and take my share of the burden. I’ll order the Banquet.”"
1934,"Go tell your master I’m coming; and if you happen to see Mistress Alice, his daughter, give Matthew Maule’s humble respects to her. She has brought a fair face from Italy,—fair, and gentle, and proud,—has that same Alice Pyncheon!”  “He talk of Mistress Alice!” cried Scipio, as he returned from his errand. “ The low carpenter-man! He no business so much as to look at her a great way off!” [SNIPPET] What are you doing here?’  ‘It’s your room to be sure,’ said Jonas; ‘but I’m almost inclined to ask you what you are doing here? My room is on the other side of that door. No one told me last night not to open it. I thought it led into a passage, and was coming out to order breakfast. There’s—there’s no bell in my room.’  Montague had in the meantime admitted the man with his hot water and boots, who hearing this, said, yes, there was; and passed into the adjoining room to point it out, at the head of the bed."
1935,"cried the girl, determinedly.  The man was about to attempt to dissuade her, when Sing interrupted.  “You keepee still, Bulan,” he said. “ You wait till Sing tellee. You no mlonster. Mlaxon he no makee you. Sing he find you in low bloat jus’ outsidee cove. You dummy. No know nothing. [SNIPPET] He'd been half knocked out, but his head was clearing already. Of far greater importance was the fact that Ora was unharmed; he satisfied himself of that immediately. ""I'm all right,"" he grunted, struggling to his feet and feeling around in the blackness. The lights in the passage were out and he groped blindly along the partition, the metal of which had suddenly become very hot to the touch. There was a curious feeling of lightness as if his body had no weight at all; the ship rolled gently and he knew they were falling swiftly to the inevitable crash."
1936,"He had the feeling, the concept, that this action held meaning. It was supposed to cause some reaction, accomplish an act. He wondered at the regular movement of his legs. One of them hurt. A hurt is a sensation of pain, caused by over-loading sensory-units in the body; a hurt is bad, because it indicates something is wrong. [SNIPPET] He'll be dead soon,"" he snapped. "" Another few minutes now is all it'll take. Just a few more."" ""Absurd. There's nothing in these stimuli that can kill him."""
1937,"Nay, thus; courage, and cling firm.”  As she spoke her form dilated, the vast wings expanded. Clinging to her, I was borne aloft through the terrible chasm. The starry light from her forehead shot around and before us through the darkness. Brightly and steadfastly, and swiftly as an angel may soar heavenward with the soul it rescues from the grave, went the flight of the Gy, till I heard in the distance the hum of human voices, the sounds of human toil. We halted on the flooring of one of the galleries of the mine, and beyond, in the vista, burned the dim, feeble lamps of the miners. Then I released my hold. The Gy kissed me on my forehead, passionately, but as with a mother’s passion, and said, as the tears gushed from her eyes, “Farewell for ever. Thou wilt not let me go into thy world—thou canst never return to mine. [SNIPPET] These sounds were mingled with the roaring of the sea, the splash of the chafed billows round the vessel’s sides, and the gurgling up of the water in the hold. The crew, many of whom had never seen the sea before, felt indeed as if heaven and earth came ruining together, as the vessel dipped her bows in the waves, or rose high upon them. Their yells were drowned in the clamour of elements, and the thunder rivings of their unwieldy habitation—they discovered at last that the water gained on them, and they betook themselves to their pumps; they might as well have laboured to empty the ocean by bucketfuls. As the sun went down, the gale encreased; the ship seemed to feel her danger, she was now completely water-logged, and presented other indications of settling before she went down. The bay was crowded with vessels, whose crews, for the most part, were observing the uncouth sportings of this huge unwieldy machine—they saw her gradually sink; the waters now rising above her lower decks—they could hardly wink before she had utterly disappeared, nor could the place where the sea had closed over her be at all discerned. Some few of her crew were saved, but the greater part clinging to her cordage and masts went down with her, to rise only when death loosened their hold.  This event caused many of those who were about to sail, to put foot again on firm land, ready to encounter any evil rather than to rush into the yawning jaws of the pitiless ocean. But these were few, in comparison to the numbers who actually crossed. Many went up as high as Belfast to ensure a shorter passage, and then journeying south through Scotland, they were joined by the poorer natives of that country, and all poured with one consent into England."
1938,"The eavesdropper could see nothing clearly. Round and round they veered in a whirl of turmoil. Presently Prince Edward trod upon the broken flask, smashing it. His foot slipped in the spilth of wine, and the huge body went down like an oak, his head striking one leg of the table. [SNIPPET] It would be the Amen of his life to have praised God, not upon a harp, but upon a ship that should carry her own power, that should store wind or its equivalent as she stored her victuals, that should be something wrested from the chaos of uninvention and ordered and disciplined and subordinated to Abel Keeling's will…. And there she was, that ship-shaped thing of spirit-grey, with the four pipes that resembled a phantom organ now broadside and of equal length. And the ghost-crew of that ship were speaking again…. The interrupted silver chain by the quarterdeck balustrade had now become continuous, and the balusters made a herring-bone over their own motionless reflections."
1939,"When that energy ceased death had come quickly. Those figures in the cells were no longer Shining Ones. Their bodies were already swiftly darkening in decay. Foster smiled grimly as he looked around the cavern. [SNIPPET] Come sit down."" She backed to the big double bed and relaxed into it, lying on one elbow. Don sat next to her, but upright. "" Tell me about this fealty deal. What did you have to do?"" ""Oh, renounce my American citizenship and swear to protect Superior against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The usual thing."" ""Have you got a title yet? Are you Dame Jervis?"""
1940,"“Exactly: that makes it so annoying that Brooke should have put a man who has a sort of connection with the family in a position of that kind. For my part, I think Ladislaw is rather a fool for accepting.”  “It is Aquinas’s fault,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “ Why didn’t he use his interest to get Ladislaw made an attache or sent to India? That is how families get rid of troublesome sprigs.”  “There is no knowing to what lengths the mischief may go,” said Sir James, anxiously. “ But if Casaubon says nothing, what can I do?”  “Oh my dear Sir James,” said the Rector, “don’t let us make too much of all this. It is likely enough to end in mere smoke. [SNIPPET] Anything is easy to him. Not that cleverness has anything to do with it. I am ten times cleverer than many men who pass.”  “Dear me!” said Mary, unable to repress her sarcasm; “that accounts for the curates like Mr. Crowse. Divide your cleverness by ten, and the quotient—dear me!—is able to take a degree."
1941,"Suddenly they were not alone. No sound was generated by the man's coming. One instant they were talking alone, the next he was here. Earl saw him first. He was a middle-aged man whose hair was completely white. He stood near the desk, easily, as if standing there were the most natural way to relax. [SNIPPET] A spot check shows that most of the executives of the London branch of the Psychical Research Society are spending quiet evenings in their homes. Our Inspector Ottermole actually spoke to Dr. Carnacki, the head of the office here.” “Oh,” Malone said. “They haven’t skipped,” Teal went on. “ Is this in connection with anything serious, Mr. Malone?” “Not yet,” Malone said. “"
1942,"Suddenly my eyes fell upon Ingra, who had not previously made his appearance. He was as insane as the others, and like many of them had a knife in his hand. In a moment he pushed his way toward Ala, and my heart rose in my throat, for I did not know what mad thought might be in his mind. If I had had a weapon, I believe I should have shot him, but before he had arrived within three yards of the queen there came an explosion of flame—I do not know how else to describe it, for it was so sudden—and the great platform was instantly wrapped in licking tongues of fire. The wickerwork caught like tinder, and the gauzy screws threw off streams of sparks like so many Fourth of July pinwheels. The gush of heat from the conflagration was terrible, and I turned my eyes in horror from the stricken multitude which seemed to have been shocked back into sanity by the sudden universal danger only to find itself a helpless prey to the flames. ""It's all over with them!"" cried Jack. [SNIPPET] ""But the Mehrikans of gentle blood,"" I asked, ""had they no titles?""  The Wooden God. ""Neither titles nor gentle blood,"" he answered. "" And as they were all of much the same origin, and came to this country simply to thrive more fatly than at home, there was nothing except difference in wealth on which to establish a superior order. Being deep respecters of money this was a satisfying distinction. It soon resulted that those families who possessed riches for a generation or two became the substitute for an aristocracy. This upper class was given to sports and pastimes, spending their wealth freely, being prodigiously fond of display. Their intellectual development was feeble, and they wielded but little influence save in social matters."
1943,"One would think you had forgotten every lesson you ever learned."" ""Oh, I am truly sorry!"" Raoul's face became a pleasing shade of pink, which made him look much more human. Maybe it was the wrong color, but at least it was a color. "" Please to accept my apologies, reverend sir."" ""It's quite all right."" Bbulas reverted to graciousness. "" [SNIPPET] You, yourself, have done nothing unlawful. You cannot very well be sent back to sleep, and undoubtedly the council will want to hear you. I am curious as to what you will say."" ""About Sako?"""
1944,"Every man dreams of the season-changed countryside as an escape; every man dreams of a woman on whose broad breast he may rest, beneath whose tumbling hair and moth-like hands he may discover forgetfulness and freedom. Some men are successful in a quest for those anodynes. Hugo could understand the sharp contours of one fact: because he was himself, such a quest would always end in failure. No woman lived who could assuage him; his fires would not yield to any temporal powers. He was barren of desire to investigate deeper into the philosophy of himself. All people turned aside by fate fall into the same morass. Except in his strength, Hugo was pitifully like all people: wounds could easily be opened in his sensitiveness; his moral courage could be taxed to the fringe of dilemma; he looked upon his fellow men sometimes with awe at the variety of high places they attained in spite of the heavy handicap of being human—he looked upon them again with repugnance—and very rarely, as he grew older, did such inspections of his kind include a study of the difference between them and him made by his singular gift. [SNIPPET] I felt the great fear-loneliness in the other Marl begin to recede and in its place came an almost overpowering euphoria. It was contentment, and it stemmed from the basic emotion love. I knew this at once. I suddenly realized that I too was relieved, that I was no longer sick with fear-loneliness. It was good, this existing of the other within me or simultaneously with me. Or was it I within the other? It sated our fear emotion and made, created a love-euphoria. ""I am happy I found you,"" I communicated. "" I was lonely for another Marl."
1945,"""Furthermore,"" said Dane, ""I recommend that we withdraw all agents from Earth. We can't conceal our superior mental development and advanced technology much longer. ""Someone's bound to catch on pretty soon. I was against this plan in the Galactic Council in the first place, you'll remember. Well, farewell, Thandor! I'll be seeing you soon in space!"" [SNIPPET] And I have to find them. They need me."" Mr. Marsh looked away from the man to his daughter, and Carol was a little slow in avoiding his eyes. "" I see,"" he said, and she had an idea of what he meant by that. He saw too much. If he knew, there was nothing she could do about it. She said, ""Perhaps Mr.—"" She paused, and the man said dully, ""Callendar."" ""Perhaps if Mr. Callendar would have dinner with us and tell us a little more, we'd be better able to help."""
1946,"I'm sorry too, but people don't change."" The remark startled him. He had used it occasionally to rationalize his position, had been convinced of its undeniable truth—yet suddenly he realized that he himself was its living denial. People could change, just as he had changed, just as Dorothy could change. It had been partly his fault when he first gave in to something he didn't want to do, and then to something else, and something else after that. He had helped dig the rut in which he had found himself, taking it for granted just as Dorothy had taken it for granted. Her hair was soft in the same moonlight that had shone eight years before, and Sam Meecham felt a desire that had been too long unfulfilled. [SNIPPET] The tone was one reserved for humoring madmen. Burke turned, gesturing. "" Better come along, Mr. Phillips. Your wife and Dr. Buehl are waiting at the hotel."" The gate was open now, but there was no sign of a watchman; if one worked here, Sylvia's money would have taken care of that, of course. Dane went along quietly, sitting in the rubble of his hopes while the big car purred through the morning and on down Lindell Boulevard toward the hotel."
1947,"But you said blood stream?"" ""Yes,"" Heidel nodded. "" This had to be done before the cadaver was a cadaver, you see?"" ""I think so, yes,"" said Forbes, leaning back again. "" Murdered the bastard for an autopsy, what?"" Heidel's fingers closed around the pistol. "" [SNIPPET] The hotel whirred inside itself. The airport tensed and searched the sky. Time moved and the swelling throngs jammed the sidewalks, raising their strengthening sound between the tall buildings. Windows popped open and faces beamed. Tentative showers of confetti drifted down through the air. The city waited, its pulse thumping. The rocket was a black point in the sky."
1948,"Travis shouted. "" Hold up your man! I do not want to kill!"" The shaman called out, but the lancer was already level with the vanished tree, his head half turned on his shoulders to witness the blackened earth where it had stood. Then he dropped his lance, sawed on the reins. A rifle bullet might not have halted his charge, unless it killed or wounded, but what he had just seen was a thing beyond his understanding. The tribesmen sat their horses, facing Travis, watching him with the feral eyes of the wolves they claimed as forefathers, wolves that possessed the cunning of the wild, cunning enough not to rush breakneck into unknown danger. Travis walked forward. "" [SNIPPET] The procession back to the temple was made quietly and sedately along an empty roadway. Yat-Zar seemed to be in a kindly humor; the people of Zurb had no intention of giving him any reason to change his mood. The priests of Muz-Azin and their torturers had been flung into the dungeon. Yorzuk, appointed regent for the duration of Kurchuk's penance, had taken control and was employing Hulgun spearmen and hastily-converted Chuldun archers to restore order and, incidentally, purge a few of his personal enemies and political rivals. The priests, with the three prisoners who had been found carrying First Level weapons among them and Yat-Zar floating triumphantly in front, entered the temple. A few of the devout, who sought admission after them, were told that elaborate and secret rites were being held to cleanse the profaned altar, and sent away. Verkan Vall and Brannad Klav and Stranor Sleth were in the conveyer chamber, with the Paratime Policemen and the extra priests; along with them were the three prisoners. Verkan Vall pulled off his false beard and turned to face these."
1949,"They put through the call, but Charlie wasn't answering. "" Sorry,"" the operator said. "" Nobody's gotten through there for three days."" ""Three days?"" cried Tommy. "" What's wrong? Is he dead?"" ""Couldn't be. They burned out two more machines yesterday,"" said the operator. "" [SNIPPET] Slowly he raised his head. He stood ankle-deep in gold crystals that stretched out forever in a splendid sea of flame. The crystals sang softly, achingly, to a silver sun in an emerald sky. A grove of blue needle trees tinkled in ecstasy on his left. And beyond those trees."
1950,"The “General Grant” passed, on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and was at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true, exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour, and there were only twenty-eight left. But, though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November, accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred. [SNIPPET] Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s recital, and in which pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with indignation and abhorrence.  “Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as biled—is rich, too; ain’t it?”  “Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister.  O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say it was weak, and I was lost!"
1951,"""Uh, what's the name please?"" ""Tee Ormond. I own the Starduster."" The clerk pulled a card from a file on the desk and studied it. "" Ah, yes, the Starduster."" [SNIPPET] He looked up slowly at the murky canopy of clouds. If I only knew when! He looked indecisively up and down the field, then squaring his shoulders resolutely, set out for the administration building. At this hour the office was deserted except for a wispy-haired little man who sat at a desk fussing with some papers. He looked up questioningly as Tee came in. ""Is my ship re-charged and provisioned?"""
1952,"COME AT ONCE STOP AM IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE ... The only kind of terrible trouble Matilda could be in was if some swindler talked her out of some of her capital! And that definitely would not be easy to do. I grinned to myself at the recollection of her worrying herself sick once over what would happen to her if there was a revolution and the new government refused to honor the old government bonds. Things began to make sense. Her telegram, then those pictures moved around in the front room, and the one she had forgotten to hide, in the guest room. If the other pictures were anything like it, I could see how Aunt Matilda might cash in on part of her securities to invest in what she thought was a sure thing. But sure things are only as good as the people in control of them. [SNIPPET] He squeezed the trigger, the room echoed and there was blackness. Heidel held his pistol poised over the table. Silence. ""Well,"" said Forbes finally. "" There you have it. Surprise, what?"" Heidel balanced the pistol, feeling his palm go suddenly moist against the black grip, and he looked around at the five pairs of glowing eyes. ""Bit of a shock, I should imagine,"" Forbes said. """
1953,"I think back and try not to. In the hermetically sealed cylinder back upstairs among my Americana Spink I have some photographs, Circa 1945. One is of a citizen of old Nazi Germany who was supposed to have cremated himself in a bunker. Papers there record that my forebear, Cyril Spink, had his doubts at the time. ""I am the Neofeuhrer, Earthman,"" this creep says. "" I will conquer the universe."" ""Look,"" I says, pawing beads of sweat as big as the creep's eyes from my brow, ""have you been testin' atom bombs and worse down here?"" ""Jar."" ""There, I knew Professor Zalpha was off the beam,"" I yelp at Wurpz. "" [SNIPPET] ""I wouldn't forget,"" Billy Kasker said. ""But, Billy, it's been twelve years since I traded you, as a kid of five, for one of their brats—changing the bracelet as I changed you. Many times since then I've thought you had forgotten, or that I wouldn't live to see the day when you came back here with a graduating class."" ""I don't forget,"" Billy Kasker said. "" I'm even class president!"""
1954,"He just smiled. ""Well, here goes,"" he said. "" It's finished. Now to find out who is right, the scientists and philosophers who say reality is forever unreachable, or the artists who say there isn't any reality—that we make the whole thing up to suit ourselves."" He moved one of those pointers you see there, and squinted around at the different scales and dials, and then stepped back. That little tessy-thing appeared, real small at first. [SNIPPET] ""Speaking of luck,"" I asked, ""What's the news from the kennels? Has Ponto met his fiancee yet or haven't the banns been published?"" ""Dalrymple seemed to think that it would be very easy to equip him with a suitable girl friend,"" she said demurely. "" It appears that there's a war-time shortage of sires or something, so I gather that there's no particular problem in Ponto's love-life. Dalrymple said we could come and get him the end of the week—Friday or Saturday. Poor dear."
1955,"Things were hectic already, less than four months after we'd started. And we hadn't much to show, except a shift in the roadbed of the SF & D RR. The opposition, growing stronger each day, could sit back and rest the case, with nothing more than a smug, needling, I-told-you-so look. The day finally came when we broke ground for the building. [SNIPPET] You're Rodney Maxwell's son, aren't you? Your father's one of our regular freight shippers. Been sending out a lot of stuff lately."" He looked as though he would have liked to continue the conversation, but said: ""Sorry, I've got to go. Lot of things to attend to before landing."" He touched the visor of his cap and turned away."
1956,"Well, I will tell him; I promise you that. And now what am I to do with you?"" The boy made a grimace. "" We may part as we have met, with no one the wiser."" ""I am not so sure of that,"" said the other, suspiciously. "" You are a Doomsman, and you know me to be a Stockader—a spy, if you like. If it were for myself alone I might trust you, but so much may hang——"" He stopped abruptly and his eyes darkened. "" The only sure way lies at my knife-point."" [SNIPPET] The two things are as intimately related as own brothers. If you should care to hunt up the kite sticks, you would find that they, too, are now artemisium plated.” “This is getting too deep for me,” was all that I could say. “I am not absolutely confident that I have touched bottom myself,” said Hall, “but I’m going to make another dive, and if I don’t bring up treasures greater than Vanderdecken found at the bottom of the sea, then Dr. Syx is even a more wonderful human mystery than I have thought him to be.” “What do you propose to do next?”"
1957,"""Don't talk to me, you miserable man,"" Erika said. "" You monster, you."" ""I can't help it,"" Martin cried wildly. "" I'll be a coward for twelve hours. [SNIPPET] It flaked off when it tried to pry open the man-hole cover of ray Dart. A moment after that I got Radivision arc directions from London Field, aimed my sights, and shot for Earth. It was a miracle I escaped."" ""But surely your ray-pistol—"" Harley had begun, preserving a discreet silence about the man's delusion concerning the stone splinter. ""I tell you it was useless as a toy! Never before have I seen any form of life that could stand up against a ray-gun."
1958,"You are not one of us—you will not, therefore, object to the letter being read. I will spare you undue annoyance by formally glancing over it.” “The rule is reasonable enough, captain, and requires no defence.” “It shall be given to one of the delegates when we touch land in Switzerland. A convention of importance is to be held there. But, come, I will take you round the Attila,” and striding by me he passed out of the study. “What was that land visible just now, captain?” I asked, as we reached one of the stairways that led down into the vessel. [SNIPPET] Our situation, stranded without possibility of escape in such a land, was clearly full of danger, and our reasons endorsed every measure of caution which Lord John's experience could suggest. Yet it was surely impossible that we should halt on the edge of this world of mystery when our very souls were tingling with impatience to push forward and to pluck the heart from it.  We therefore blocked the entrance to our zareba by filling it up with several thorny bushes, and left our camp with the stores entirely surrounded by this protecting hedge. We then slowly and cautiously set forth into the unknown, following the course of the little stream which flowed from our spring, as it should always serve us as a guide on our return."
1959,"""Ah—two young heroes,"" Ledman said acidly. "" How sad. I could almost feel sorry for you. Almost."" ""Just what is it you're after?"" I said, stalling, stalling. ""Atomics cost me my legs,"" he said. "" You remember the Sadlerville Blast?"" [SNIPPET] What they ought to have is somebody like one of my engine room roustabouts, too ignorant to get scared and too dumb to go nuts. Then we could get a sane report six months from now instead of the ravings of a maniac."" ""I suggest,"" he said stiffly, ""that you reserve judgement until that time comes, sir."" And that was all he knew about the danger, real or imaginary, that had driven two men into insanity. He would have six months in which to find the answer. Six months minus— He looked at the chronometer and saw that twenty minutes had passed since he left the cruiser."
1960,"""You'll want bars like mine,"" Krell continued, ""for they're damned handy when you get jammed between wreckage masses. Exploring this wreck-pack is no soft job: I can tell you from experience."" Liggett and the rest had their suits adjusted, and with bars in their grasp, followed Krell into the airlock. Kent hung back for a last word with Crain, who, with his half-dozen remaining men, was watching. [SNIPPET] He realized, suddenly, that men had not yet learned to use fruitfully the precious, powerful things given to them, but as yet could only play with them like greedy children—and kill as they played. Already his invention had brought death. And he realized—even on this day of his triumph—that it and its secret must be destroyed, and with them he who had fashioned so blindly. For the scientist was old, his whole life was the invention, and with its going there would be nothing more. And so he used the device's great powers on his own body; and then, with those powers working on him, he destroyed the device and all the papers that held its secrets. Was the fool also mad? Perhaps."
1961,"Picking up a box from the table, she adjusted a dial. The chair in which he was sitting rose slightly from the floor and positioned itself in front of the window. The woman walked to the wall beside him and corrected the visual index of the glass to match the weakness of the old man's eyes. ""See, down there? Just look at them pushing about."" A rabble of faces swam on the glass in front of him, faces of unfamiliar people, all of them unknown and unknowable to him. Inside him the whisper of the wings mounted in pitch with a whining, leathery sound. The images of dead faces came flying up, careening across his mind, mingling and merging with the faces of the living. [SNIPPET] There was more window than wall upon its walls, and the windows went on straight around the corners, though how this kept the house standing we could not guess. The walls were hard and smooth, of that stone unlike stone which we had seen in our tunnel.  We both knew it without words: this house was left from the Unmentionable Times. The trees had protected it from time and weather, and from men who have less pity than time and weather."
1962,"The blue light glowed, purpled. Another bolt struck down, and another, and still they were not dead. The fire-things had become a writhing, joyous tangle of tenuous bodies, glowing bright and brighter. Stunned, incredulous, the three humans stood. The light was now an eye-searing violet. Static electricity tingled through them in eerie waves. [SNIPPET] He sat down and placed the card in front of him. Then, making sure he was unobserved, he broke a company rule and began to Think. Something's wrong, he thought. Something is terribly wrong. Twenty-four pink cards in the last month. Twenty-four out of forty."
1963,"No, my friend, the Machine is here to stay. And the Mars Convicts may as well resign themselves to the fact."" Rainbolt replied earnestly that he was not too well informed in economics, that not being his field. However, he had been told and believed that while the situation described by the spokesman would be true today, it should not take many years to train the populations of Earth to run their affairs quite as efficiently as the Machine had done, and without loss of personal and political liberties. [SNIPPET] ""Nor do I,"" consented Crownwall. "" But your stooge here doesn't seem very happy about it all."" His Effulgence wiggled his tentacles. "" I'm afraid that Ggaran had expected to take what you Earthlings have to offer without giving anything in return. I never had any such ideas. I have not underestimated you, you see."" ""That's nice,"" said Crownwall graciously."
1964,"Get a hammer.”  ‘The little engineer whimpered like a child, but, broken arm and all, he turned out the least craven of the lot as it seems, and, actually, mustered enough pluck to run an errand to the engine-room. No trifle, it must be owned in fairness to him. Jim told me he darted desperate looks like a cornered man, gave one low wail, and dashed off. He was back instantly clambering, hammer in hand, and without a pause flung himself at the bolt. [SNIPPET] The danger is in Europe; but there before I left I took care to—’ They moved off and whispered, then their voices rose again. ‘ The extraordinary series of delays is not my fault. I did my best.’ The fat man sighed. ‘ Very sad.’ ‘ And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk,’ continued the other; ‘he bothered me enough when he was here. “ Each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things, a centre for trade of course, but also for humanizing, improving, instructing.” Conceive you—that ass!"
1965,"""Yes. My name is Tom Jordan,"" Jordan said. ""Mine's Berkhammer."" It must have been warm in California because the sheriff pulled out a large handkerchief and mopped his brow. [SNIPPET] It might have been another world. Some of it was recognizable. A massive radio-telephone set, by which, he judged, all communications between the fleets in the Pacific were overheard; a squat dynamo; a set of huge cylinders, from which, probably, had come the highly expansive gas that had snuffed out the crews of the two dirigibles. But there were other things—strange, monstrous."
1966,"Why didn't you just radio for assistance?"" forgetting as young persons do, that things have not always been as they are to-day. The Ertak's sending apparatus, for example, could reach out at best no more than a day's journey in any direction, and then only imperfectly. Transmission of thought by radio instead of symbols or words, had been introduced but a few years before I entered the Service. It must be remembered that I am an old, old man, writing of things that happened before most of the present population of the Universe was born—that I am writing of men who, for the larger part, have long since embarked upon the Greatest Adventure. ""Base, sir,"" said the operator after a moment, and I hastily slipped on the radio-menore. ""Commander John Hanson, standing by,"" I shot at the operator at Base. "" Have you orders?"" [SNIPPET] he said. But all friendliness was erased as he swung back upon the Commander. No thought now of the thousands of staring faces or of the millions throughout the world who were watching him and were hearing his words. Chet Bullard clipped those words into curt phrases, and he shot them at his superior officer as if from a detonite gun: ""You think your judgment better than mine—you've dropped me from the Service—and you've got the power to make that stick! But you're wrong, sir, dead wrong! And I'll make you admit it, too."
1967,"By long experience of his integrity and wisdom, the Prince and his sister were convinced that he might be trusted without danger; and lest he should draw any false hopes from the civilities which he received, discovered to him their condition, with the motives of their journey, and required his opinion on the choice of life. “Of the various conditions which the world spreads before you which you shall prefer,” said the sage, “I am not able to instruct you. I can only tell that I have chosen wrong. I have passed my time in study without experience—in the attainment of sciences which can for the most part be but remotely useful to mankind. I have purchased knowledge at the expense of all the common comforts of life; I have missed the endearing elegance of female friendship, and the happy commerce of domestic tenderness. If I have obtained any prerogatives above other students, they have been accompanied with fear, disquiet, and scrupulosity; but even of these prerogatives, whatever they were, I have, since my thoughts have been diversified by more intercourse with the world, begun to question the reality. [SNIPPET] We had been seven weeks at sea, when the gunner told the captain that, by his reckoning, we must be in soundings, and desired he would order the lead to be heaved. Crampley swore he did not know how to keep the ship’s way, for we were not within a hundred leagues of soundings, and therefore he would not give himself the trouble to cast the lead. Accordingly we continued our course all that afternoon and night, without shortening sail, although the gunner pretended to discover Scilly light; and next morning protested in form against the captain’s conduct, for which he was put in confinement, We discovered no land all that day, and Crampley was still so infatuated as to neglect sounding; but at three o’clock in the morning the ship struck, and remained fast on a sand-bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the boat was immediately hoisted out, but as we could not discern which way the shore lay, we were obliged to wait for daylight. In the meantime, the wind increased, and the waves beat against the sloop with such violence, that we expected she would have gone to pieces. The gunner was released and consulted: he advised the captain to cut away the mast, in order to lighten her; this expedient was performed without success: the sailors, seeing things in a desperate situation, according to custom, broke up the chests belonging to the officers, dressed themselves in their clothes, drank their liquors without ceremony, and drunkenness, tumult, and confusion ensued."
1968,"We'll let no one inside the Pallas until you and Liggett and the men get back."" In a few minutes they were out of the ship, with Krell and Kent and Liggett leading, and the twelve members of the Pallas' crew following closely. The three leaders climbed up on the Uranus-Jupiter passenger-ship that lay beside the Pallas, the others moving on and exploring the neighboring wrecks in parties of two and three. From the top of the passenger-ship, when they gained it, Kent and his two companions could look far out over the wreck-pack. It was an extraordinary spectacle, this stupendous mass of dead ships floating motionless in the depths of space, with the burning stars above and below them. His companions and the other men clambering over the neighboring wrecks seemed weird figures in their bulky suits and transparent helmets. Kent looked back at the Pallas, and then along the wreck-pack's edge to where he could glimpse the silvery side of the Martian Queen. [SNIPPET] The full title of the project is A Study of the Metamorphosis of the Markovian Nucleus."" ""What happened? How are they any different from the way they used to be?"" ""A hundred and fifty years ago the Markovians were the meanest, nastiest, orneriest specimens in the entire Council of Galactic Associates. The groups of worlds in one corner of their galaxy, which make up the Nucleus, controlled a military force that outweighed anything the Council could possibly bring to bear against them. ""With complete disregard of any scheme of interplanetary rules or order they harassed and attacked peaceful shipping and inoffensive cultures throughout a wide territory. They were something demanding the Council's military action. But the Council lacked the strength. ""For years the Council dragged on, debating and threatening ineffectively."
1969,"I've got to go to town late this afternoon, but I was wondering if you'd have time to meet me at the Recreation House at Oppenheimer Village for a game of chess. I'm calling from there, now."" ""Fine; I can make it,"" Lowiewski's voice replied. "" I'm in the middle of a devil's own mathematical problem; maybe a game of chess would clear my head. I have a new queen's-knight gambit I want to try on you, anyhow."" Bertie Wooster looked up sharply. "" Now there; that may be what we're—"" The telephone beside MacLeod rang. [SNIPPET] A ripple of astonished comment ran along the line and the other guards bellowed for silence. Kulan fingered the black tube of his neutro-beam and his broad face was chalky white.  Luke advanced two paces, still grinning. And he looked up sneeringly into the grim face that was a foot above his own.  ""That's right, you big ape,"" he grated, ""you ain't man enough to fight the way men fight. Gotta use dart guns, or gravity.""  It was sheer baiting of the big Martian. Fenton was shrewd and he knew the fellow's kind, quick to resent insult and prouder of their physical size and prowess than of any other possession."
1970,"We can't be sure. It's too much to hope there was no destruction of human life after an explosion of that magnitude."" Corriston suddenly realized that he was behaving like a man who had taken complete leave of his wits. He was drawing more and more attention to himself when he should have been bending all of his efforts toward making himself as inconspicuous as possible. Fortunately the agitation of everyone on the promenade was helping to remedy his blunder. [SNIPPET] Then hit pay dirt! Why, it was that bluff, hearty-looking, red-headed man in the third chair to his right. He didn't look vicious, that was certain, though there was a grim set to his jaw. Yet his surface thoughts showed the man to be hard, cold and ruthless—a pure killer type. Hanson sensed he was one of those men who have such a will to power that the lives and rights of others are held cheaply, contemptuously. The kind who, if another gets in his way, removes him ... but carefully, lest his own highly-valuable skin be put in jeopardy. If he could get some one else to do the dirty work, so much the better. Such conscienceless killers were, Hanlon knew, usually arrant cowards. There was someone on this ship who was in this man's way—of that Hanlon felt sure."
1971,"Even as they looked an enormous gate opened and a procession of mounted figures emerged. In the event the place was deserted, the Captain would have had the honor of being the first to touch Martian soil. While atmospheric and other checks were being run, he gave orders for the previously decided alternative. Captain, semanticist and anthropologist would make the First Contact. [SNIPPET] They too, Madeleine was sure, were artificial. Mrs. Ericson adjusted her polaroid glasses and waved her rickshaw boy into his harness, where his thighs tensed for the long haul. He was an incredibly huge man, taller even than those specially-bred movie stars, who averaged eight feet tall. Madeleine felt faint and clung to her camel. The Martian camels were coughing and wheezing and the sun glared horribly in the early afternoon. Mr. Ericson looked with guarded apprehension at the six-legged camel."
1972,"""Yes, dear,"" sighed Mater. At long last, Junior seemed to have resigned himself to making the best of it. With considerable exertions, hampered by his increasing bottom-heaviness, he was fetching loads of stones, seaweed and other debris to a spot downslope, and there laboring over what promised to be a fairly ambitious cairn. Judging by what they could see of it, his homesite might even prove a credit to the colony (so went Pater's thoughts) and attract a mate who would be a good catch (thus Mater mused). Junior was still to be seen at times along the reef in company with his free-swimming friends among the other polyps, at some of whom his parents had always looked askance, fearing they were by no means well-bred. In fact, there was strong suspicion that some of them—waifs from the disreputable Shallows district in the hazardous reaches just below the tide-mark—had never been bred at all, but were products of budding, a practice frowned on in polite society. However, Junior's appearance and rate of locomotion made it clear he would soon be done with juvenile follies. As Pater repeated with satisfaction—you can't beat Biology; as one becomes more and more bottle-shaped, the romantic illusions of youth must inevitably perish. ""I always knew there was sound stuff in the youngster,"" declared Pater expansively. [SNIPPET] the alien told himself aloud. Longtree regarded the alien carefully. As Channeljumper had said, the creature was short and had close-cropped hair on its head. The legs were brief and pudgy, and Longtree felt a shade of pity for the creature who could obviously not get around as well as they. It was undoubtedly intelligent—the space rocket testified to that—and the fact that the creature's skin color stayed a peaceful pink-orange helped assure Longtree the alien's mission was friendly. The alien raised a short arm and stepped slowly forward. "" I come in peace,"" he said in the language they could not understand. """
1973,"The distant ramparts of the world swung madly, and he seemed to fall upward, away from the sun that suddenly glared under the hippogriff's talons. He forced his knees under the roots of the beating wings and dug heels into prickling hair. A sob caught his breath and he clenched his teeth. The universe righted itself about him for a moment and he pulled breath into his lungs. Then they plunged again. [SNIPPET] Perfectly, perfectly! You're Colonel Peter Johns of Pamworth, Pennsylvania, and this is your great-great-great-great-granddaughter, Rebecca Johns-Hayes."" ""Rebecca? You mean she's named after Becky Sayles?"" The Colonel rubbed a hand across his several days' growth of beard. ""That's right, dear great-great-great-great-grandfather. I'm named after great-great-great-great-grandmother,"" Mrs. Johns-Hayes announced. ""Then I married Becky Sayles?"""
1974,"No longer did he bring up the rear. Joe Buckner now had that position of honor. The group showed some sympathy for Billy, but not very much or very long. When he lost his position as president they seemed to change their minds about him. The group moved slowly through the city. As if nothing had happened, the instructor explained what they were seeing. When they asked questions, he answered them. [SNIPPET] Really, it was a cinch to be a god. The beasts that were such great dangers to them were mere trifles to him. To him, with a gun loaded with a thousand thermal charges each of which was capable of blasting armor plate. The thing wouldn't even have come close if he himself hadn't been such a timid, cowardly fool. Put Malevski in his place, and the detective would have got the creature as it came out of the trees. He wasn't Malevski. It was a good thing for him that they couldn't know that. Now his position was completely secure. Now he could relax and enjoy his divine life."
1975,"I stared at him. I began to think of a thousand tiny slivers whizzing around erratically, richocheting off buildings, in downtown San Francisco and in twenty counties, and no matter what they hit, moving and accelerating as long as there was any heat in the air to give them energy. And then I saw a tool shed, on the other side of the pasture from us. But Farnsworth was ahead of me, waddling along, puffing. He got the shovels out and handed one to me. We didn’t say a word, neither of us, for hours. It takes a long time to fill a hole twenty feet deep—especially when you’re shoveling very, very carefully and packing down the dirt very, very hard. The spelling of ""richochet"" has been retained as in the original. [SNIPPET] I want the names of your higher ups, and the address of your central office, Flowers. Frankly, you're in the soup. As you possibly know, our hush-hush department has unlimited emergency powers, being answerable only to the President."" ""I ... I've never even heard of it."" Flowers stuttered. "" But—"" Tracy held up a contemptuous hand. "" Many people haven't,"" he said curtly. Frank Tracy hurried through the outer office into LaVerne Sandell's domain, and bit out to her, ""Tell the Chief I'm here."
1976,"Leffingwell should have waited,"" he said. "" It's the second generation that will be important. As I tried to tell my people—"" ""Is that why you're here?"" Chang sighed. "" I suppose so. [SNIPPET] And this very day, a huge statue of Jacob Clark, the creator and benefactor, was to be dedicated on the site of what once had been his laboratory. It seemed a shame that most of the records concerning him and his time had been lost in one of the great wars that had helped to extinguish the humans. The statue though was good for surely he looked like a robot. One of the few human books still in existence said that the Creator had created in his own image. It was right at the foot of his own statue that the Guardians of the Shrine found Jacob Clark. They picked up his unconscious, bleeding body and laid it tenderly on a nearby bench. They bent over him with all the gentleness and solicitude that had been installed in his very first models and had been handed down from generation to generation of robots. They wanted to help him but they were very puzzled."
1977,"Never been able to spend them, though,"" he said. He tossed the little pile into the air, and then whipped them back into his fist again, and laughed. "" Never was able to spend them on anything."" ""I'm sorry,"" Geo said after a moment. Urson looked up. "" Why? I guess these are my jewels, huh? Maybe everyone has theirs some place. You think it was old Cat, maybe, sometimes when I was in the brig, perhaps, earning that third coin, slicing out that little four-armed monster's tongue? [SNIPPET] B. M.

1978,"Everybody says to elm with me. But, as they say in France, ve are alo-o-one now, mon cherry, and tree's a crowd."" ""Don't get ideas,"" she snapped. ""Oh, I'll get plenty of ideas, though I admit this isn't the place to carry them out."" Dalgetty folded his arms behind his head and blinked up at the sky. "" Man, could I use a nice tall mint julep right now."" Elena frowned. "" If you're trying to convince me you're just a simple American boy you might as well quit,"" she said thinly. "" [SNIPPET] ""Is this everything, Frank?"" he asked. ""That's everything, Mr. President; everything we know. We've got eight men locked up in St. Elizabeth's, all of them absolutely psychotic, and one human vegetable named Paul Wendell. We can't get anything out of them."" The President leaned back in his chair. "" I really can't quite understand it."
1979,"I'll be right over—before it gets cold."" Then immediately I turned the knob to the Municipal Aerial-car yards, and ordered my motor, as I grabbed my hat and hurried to the roof. In due time, of course, I sprang the big surprise of the evening, adding: ""And, of course, I'm going by the Tube, I feel sort of a half-partnership in it because you were one of the designers."" A curious half-pained look crossed his face. We had finished our meal, and were smoking with pushed-back chairs. [SNIPPET] Now, when the due train comes out of the suction tube, it goes on out the gate, but the air behind it travels right on around and comes in behind the train that is leaving."" ""But how are you assured that it will not stall somewhere?"" ""It won't be likely to with pressure pumps going behind it and suction pumps pulling from in front. We can always put extra power on if necessary. Thus far the road has worked perfectly."" ""How much power do you need to send it through, under normal conditions?"" ""Our trains have been averaging about fifty tons, and for that weight we have found that a pound pressure is quite sufficient. Now, taking the tunnel's length as four thousand miles (of course it is not that long, but round figures are most convenient) and the tube width eleven and one quarter feet each and working this out we have 3,020,000 cubic feet of free air per minute or 2,904,000 cubic feet of compressed air, which would use about 70,000 horse power on the air compressor."""
1980,"Then I drew on the white silk robe, embroidered with the Yellow Sign, and placed the crown upon my head. At last I was King, King by my right in Hastur, King because I knew the mystery of the Hyades, and my mind had sounded the depths of the Lake of Hali. I was King! The first grey pencillings of dawn would raise a tempest which would shake two hemispheres. Then as I stood, my every nerve pitched to the highest tension, faint with the joy and splendour of my thought, without, in the dark passage, a man groaned. I seized the tallow dip and sprang to the door. The cat passed me like a demon, and the tallow dip went out, but my long knife flew swifter than she, and I heard her screech, and I knew that my knife had found her. For a moment I listened to her tumbling and thumping about in the darkness, and then when her frenzy ceased, I lighted a lamp and raised it over my head. [SNIPPET] How pitiful, how meanly pitiful, is the aftermath of death. Well he remembered how many a night he woke in an agony, thinking of how his father lay in that cold, silent, dust-strewn vault, in the silence and the dark, with never a ray of light or hope or love! Gone, abandoned, forgotten by all, save perhaps one heart which bled . . . He would save little Stephen, if he could, from such a memory. He would not give any reason for refusing to go in."
1981,"They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. [SNIPPET] Who’s he when he’s at home?  —Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It’s Greek: from the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls.  —O, rocks!"
1982,"Even a casual glance at the map will show you that the center of the drought area, from an intensity standpoint, lies in Maryland, a few miles south of here."" ""In fact, just about where those two planes went down,"" added Carnes. ""Precisely, old dear. That was why we went over that section with the fleet. [SNIPPET] And so the Efficient Baxter crawled on; and as he crawled his hand, advancing cautiously, fell on something—something that was not alive; something clammy and ice-cold, the touch of which filled him with a nameless horror. To say that Baxter's heart stood still would be physiologically inexact. The heart does not stand still. Whatever the emotions of its owner, it goes on beating. It would be more accurate to say that Baxter felt like a man taking his first ride in an express elevator, who has outstripped his vital organs by several floors and sees no immediate prospect of their ever catching up with him again. There was a great cold void where the more intimate parts of his body should have been."
1983,"Except that these cherubs were slim and tanned, fantastically energetic, and apparently of depressingly high IQ. ( What these scientists did to children!) He missed Lois and was grateful for the single little girl solemnly skipping rope in a corner and paying no attention to him. The odd lingo she repeated stuck in his mind: ""Gik-lo, I-o, Rik-o, Gis-so. Gik-lo, I-o...."" Suddenly the air was filled with soft chimes. "" Lunch,"" the children shouted and ran away. Tom followed at a soberer pace along the wall of the ranch house. [SNIPPET] And if we went to the Home of the Scholars, we could learn from these also. We could ask questions of these, for they do not forbid questions.  And questions give us no rest. We know not why our curse makes us seek we know not what, ever and ever. But we cannot resist it. It whispers to us that there are great things on this earth of ours, and that we can know them if we try, and that we must know them. We ask, why must we know, but it has no answer to give us. We must know that we may know.  So we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars."
1984,"""What do you think could have?"" asked Georgie with Riseholme alacrity. ""Georgie, do you really believe in the Princess and Pocky?"" she asked. [SNIPPET] ""Let us circumvent them,"" he said. "" We can do it in this way. The chances are that all of the available fighting force of the planet Mars is now concentrated on this side and in the neighborhood of The Lake of the Sun. ""Possibly, by some kind of X-ray business, they can only see us dimly through the clouds, and if we get a little further away they will not be able to see us at all. ""Now, I suggest that a certain number of the electrical ships be withdrawn from the squadron to a great distance, while the remainder stay here; or, better still, approach to a point just beyond the reach of those streaks of lightning, and begin a bombardment of the clouds without paying any attention to whether the strokes reach through the clouds and do any damage or not. ""This will induce the Martians to believe that we are determined to press our attack at this point. ""In the meantime, while these ships are raising a hulabaloo on this side of the planet, and drawing their fire, as much as possible, without running into any actual danger, let the others which have been selected for the purpose, sail rapidly around to the other side of Mars and take them in the rear."" It was not perfectly clear what Colonel Smith intended to do after the landing had been effected in the rear of the Martians, but still there seemed a good deal to be said for his suggestion, and it would, at any rate, if carried out, enable us to learn something about the condition of things on the planet, and perhaps furnish us with a hint as to how we could best proceed in the further prosecution of the siege."
1985,"Liz did not struggle. She looked at Montcalm with a quizzical expression. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. "" My people made a mistake. [SNIPPET] I was a child."" ""I thought only criminals were brought here."" She nodded. "" Criminals, and their children."" ""When will your people come again?"" She shook her head. "" Never."
1986,"""Do you remember that rocky knoll we passed just before we landed?"" asked the lieutenant. "" If we can get this stuff there before we are attacked, we'll have a much better chance than we will in the open."" ""Good idea, Lieutenant. Carnes, connect yourself to one of these guns. I'll fasten the other on my back and carry Feodrovna. We can't leave her here to Saranoff's tender mercies."" [SNIPPET] What the temperature of the air might be directly above the cold bomb could only be conjectured. One of the infantry men from the fort, the best grenade man in the garrison, now picked up a Mills grenade, and after carefully picking out the target with his eye, aided by the strips of black cloth, flung the small missile. A hole perhaps four feet deep and twice as much across was blasted in the brittle ice. A second, third, and fourth grenade followed. At the end of that time the size and depth of the hole had been doubled. The trench catapult was set up. Half a dozen grenades were bundled together and flung into the now much enlarged opening in the surface of the ice."
1987,"You're probably all in."" ""Yes,"" Charlotte said. "" Come. I myself will bathe you."" Hugo grinned. "" Hell, no. Now we're all going on a bender to celebrate. [SNIPPET] He fought like a madman to break the coils about him. His arms and breast were greasy from the oily fish, and the sticky web did not adhere to them, but his legs and body were inextricably fastened by the elastic threads spread for just such prey as he. He paused a moment, in exhaustion. Then he saw, five yards away, the silvery and black monster waiting patiently for him to weary himself. It judged the moment propitious. The tarantula and the man were one in its eyes, one struggling thing that had fallen opportunely into its snare. They were moving but feebly now. The spider advanced delicately, swinging its huge bulk nimbly along the web, paying out a cable after it came inexorably toward him."
1988,"I see we have company."" ""I'm sorry."" His rescue from the crevasse and the little trek back across the glacier had been like something from a dream to John Drinkard. But now, with the familiar figure of Chuck across the fire, things suddenly assumed their proper proportions again. He faced his guide, who stood silently by. ""This is Chuck Evers. I'm afraid I didn't catch your name."" The man's thin face showed palely from the peaked hood that covered his head and disappeared into the bulky collar of his stout, steel-smooth jacket. ""I am called Dzell,"" he said quietly. [SNIPPET] He lifted his hands to his throat and unhooked the clasp of his cape, then hesitated. “You wear that thing to hide the hump your tickler makes?” Gusterson filled in. “ You got better taste than those other moles.” “Not to hide it, exactly,” Fay protested, “but just so the others won’t be jealous."
1989,"She was purely a source of information. ""So I'm told,"" said Maril reservedly. "" Are there any more humiliating questions you want to ask?"" He gaped at her. Then he said ruefully; ""I'm stupid, Maril, but you're touchy. There's nothing personal."" [SNIPPET] He looked down the starlit Mall ahead of him. Somebody, maybe Lester Dawes and Morgan Gatworth and Lorenzo Menardes, had gotten things finished and cleaned up. The pavement was smooth and unbroken; the litter had vanished. ""It's done wonderful things already, just because people started looking for it,"" he said. """
1990,"""On the approval of the commanding officer."" ""Please secure that approval at once. Have all lights taken out of the operating room and the windows shaded. I want to work under red light. We must examine the lungs of these men at once. With all due respect to your medical knowledge, Captain, I am not convinced that these men died of pneumonia."" ""Neither am I, Doctor, but that is the best guess I could make. I'll have things fixed up for you right away."" Dr. Bird stepped to the telephone and called the laboratory. [SNIPPET] They were waiting for Earth to make contact, for a selfish reason and for an unselfish one. MARTIAN civilization had developed in a quite different direction from that of Earth. It had developed no important knowledge of the physical sciences, no technology. But it had developed social sciences to the point where there had not been a single crime, let alone a war, on Mars for fifty thousand years. And it had developed fully the parapsychological sciences of the mind, which Earth was just beginning to discover. Mars could teach Earth much."
1991,"I tasted the words. "" When your contract's up you can write your own ticket anywhere in the system."" He blurted: ""I came here full of ideas about the wonderful work Amalgamated was doing to advance backward civilizations. Sure, the Terms have a union. They're paid at standard galactic rates for spacecraft assembly. [SNIPPET] He knew that it would bring the police running, but he also knew they would have arrived shortly in any case. The important thing was that the electronic watchdogs on the wall were now lifeless. Hunter blasted open the gate, and took the path that led east. The Von Rausch castle—and the word was scarcely a metaphor—was something lifted bodily out of a Tri-D historical romance, complete with porticos, battlements, stone-walled towers and an imitation moat where mechanical swans floated on the dark water. He crossed the moat on a rustic footbridge of plastic cleverly fabricated to seem like crudely hewn wood."
1992,"""That is the hemlock,"" Steel-Blue said. It was when he quaffed the new and stronger draught that Jon knew that his hope that it was citric acid was squelched. The acid taste was weaker which meant that the citric acid was the diluting liquid. It was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath the tang of the citric acid that was the corrosive acid. On the fourteenth day, Jon was so weak he didn't feel much like moving around. He let the cylinder feed him the hemlock. No. 1 came again to see him, and went away chuckling, ""Decrease the dilution. This Earthman at last is beginning to suffer."" [SNIPPET] He went to it, dialed the well-remembered number: ""2 B R 0 2 B."" ""Federal Bureau of Termination,"" said the very warm voice of a hostess. ""How soon could I get an appointment?"" he asked, speaking very carefully. ""We could probably fit you in late this afternoon, sir,"" she said. "" It might even be earlier, if we get a cancellation."""
1993,"So I'm getting quite a reputation as a nut! Can you imagine that? But why should I mind? My reality has a much broader and more complex scope than the limited reality of my associates. I might be fired, or even sent to a state hospital, except for the fact that Lana foresees such problems and teaches me enough things in my field that are unknown to Earth, so that my employers consider me too valuable to lose. [SNIPPET] And, Mr. Tanner is off for Mars, in a super-plausibly scientifictional way. HELL SHIP, in last year's ASTOUNDING, Arthur J. Burks put forth an idea which had been discussed by engineers before he had ever used It. They just didn't know how to do it. Mr. Burks did—didn't he write the story. At least, the idea gave him more earthly benifit than it gave the engineers."
1994,"There are several leaks. For instance, the cars are as you know, run on the principle of the monorail with a guiding rail on each side. The grooves for the rails with their three rollers are in each car. There is a slight leakage of air here."" ""You used the turbo type of blower, didn't you?"" ""Had to because of the noise. [SNIPPET] The beast made two more charges on the ship, then drew back screaming in rage from a snapped tooth. And all around us, there in the ship, the sparkling fog glittered and tried to talk.   Two hours. The beast still rages in the void outside our ship. ane is dead. She was horribly mangled. I put her in her bunk and laid a blanket over her and now the blanket is soaked in her blood. No one could have helped her."
1995,"Jocelyn cut in with the regretful announcement that Mr. Fayliss had another appointment, and called for a note of thanks to him for coming. More applause—this time unrestrained. Fayliss smiled again and swept his eyes around us, as if filled with some amusing secret. Then he said to Kutrov, ""You would find them quite understandable."" [SNIPPET] More applause—this time unrestrained. Fayliss smiled again and swept his eyes around us, as if filled with some amusing secret. Then he said to Kutrov, ""You would find them quite understandable."" I wandered over to the window, in search of air, and noted that someone had indiscreetly left a comfortable chair vacant. I was near the door, so that I could hear Jocelyn say to Fayliss: ""It was—very moving. Why, I could almost feel that you were singing about us."" Fayliss smiled again. "" That is as it should be."""
1996,"Edmund Charles Schinsake?"" Charley snorted in surprise. "" Who do you think you are?"" he said. "" Santa Claus?"" [SNIPPET] She had the peculiarly young-old look of the spinster teachers with whom Benson had worked before going to the war. ""I want to believe it, but I'm afraid to,"" another man for whom Benson had no name-association said. He was portly, gray-haired, arrogant-faced; he wore a short black jacket with a jewelled zipper-pull, and striped trousers. Benson cleared his throat. "" Just who are you people?"" he inquired. "" And just where am I?"""
1997,"You can learn a lot from her then. It takes an awful lot of study to learn how to be stupid."" My own troublesome business life came to mind and I thought to myself, ""I sometimes think I'll never learn it."" I swear I didn't say it aloud. But Star patted me consolingly and answered as though I'd spoken. [SNIPPET] ""It's pretty well garbled but I remember something about the Son of Heaven bringing the early settlers from a land of two moons on the back of his fire-breathing dragon. The dragon got sick and died so they couldn't ever get back to heaven again. There's a lot of stuff about devils, too.""  ""What about devils?""  ""I don't remember too well, but they were supposed to do terrible things to you and even to your unborn children if they ever caught you. They must have been pretty stupid though; they couldn't turn corners. My grandfather's store had devil screens at all the doors so you had to turn a corner to get in."
1998,"I want to share my life with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?"" I even had a Straightforward Approach: ""Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend that time with than you."" Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract for any kind of marriage other than Non-P—Non-Permanent, No Progeny. So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more than a blurted, ""Will you marry me?"" and I struggled with zippers and malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment at five minutes to ten. Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away. It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I was giving myself plenty of time. [SNIPPET] It was fairly certain that he was the last man alive on the Earth. The war had been thorough. Thorough as only man, a meticulous animal, could make it. There had been no neutrals in this war, no middle-of-the-road policy. You were on one side or the other. Bacteria, gas and radiations had covered the Earth like a vast cloud."
2000,"Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”  “No; never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?” [SNIPPET] “Not here?” exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly, with the flat of his hand.  “Yes, there!”  “Where is he?” He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of his grey jacket. “ Show me the way he went."
2001,"With a tremendous effort of will he had given them sufficient mental stimulus to keep them traveling without his direct will for the few minutes he would require for Ellen. Now, however, he quickly donned the metal cap and the little ball, and inserted into the orifice in his cap the swinging key which connected by chain with the key which fitted into the slot under the button marked “C-3”. He had returned to his puppets just in time. “ C-3” was Cleve, who was driving the car sent out to bring in the Colombian ape. As Barter got in touch with the car it narrowly averted a crash with a police car ... and the perspiration broke forth afresh on the body of Barter as he resumed control of his puppets. [SNIPPET] ""What is it, Monty? I was outside."" Altamont told him. ""Those fellows you had up with you yesterday; think they could be trusted to handle the guns? A couple of them are here with me,"" Loudons inquired. ""Take a chance on it; it won't cost you anything but my life, and that's not worth much at present."" ""All right; hold on."
2002,"Carathis, Morakanabad, and two or three old vizirs, whose wisdom had hitherto withstood the attraction, wishing to prevent Vathek from exposing himself in the presence of his subjects, fell down in his way to impede the pursuit; but he, regardless of their obstruction, leaped over their heads, and went on as before. They then ordered the Muezzins to call the people to prayers, both for the sake of getting them out of the way and of endeavouring by their petitions to avert the calamity; but neither of these expedients was a whit more successful: the sight of this fatal ball was alone sufficient to draw after it every beholder. The Muezzins themselves, though they saw it but at a distance, hastened down from their minarets and mixed with the crowd, which continued to increase in so surprising a manner, that scarce an inhabitant was left in Samarah, except the aged, the sick confined to their beds, and infants at the breast, whose nurses could run more nimbly without them. Even Carathis, Morakanabad, and the rest were all become of the party. [SNIPPET] I took it, and offered to carry it to my lips. She prevented me.  Her Husband was at the other end of the room, and out of hearing.  “Take care of yourself,” She continued; “My love is become hatred, and my wounded pride shall not be unatoned. Go where you will, my vengeance shall follow you!”"
2003,"As for tripping them up on a threshold—that is all nonsense. What harm has unrequited love ever done to anybody?” She laughed. “ Look at ME! When I came to your rooms this morning, thinking I loved in vain, did I seem one jot the worse for it? Did I look different?” [SNIPPET] “Keep them!” he whispered.  “I shall,” she whispered back, almost shyly. “ But these, these are for you.”"
2004,"I was scared to try it. This afternoon at 14:30, just before the farewell visits, was the deadline for viz messages to any of them. If I'd had to send mine without the word we'd agreed on that would tell him it was all right—But it was, at last! And now he knows, even if I never—even if we never—Excuse me, please, it's been a strain. I'm afraid I'm going to bawl."" We let her alone. Kids nowadays hate to be fussed over. [SNIPPET] he said. "" These look to me very much like window-boxes, nailed up. We must look into this! Yes, those are boxes, or I'm … oho, this is an adventure!"" On that wall of his sitting-room there were two windows (the third was in another corner), and, beyond the open bedroom door, on the same wall, was another."
2005,"As if the ship had really been waiting, it lifted, faster and faster. ""Major?"" ""I have it, sir."" The major's hands were flying over his bank of controls, correcting the slight unbalance of thrusts, holding the ship as steady as if he were in it. [SNIPPET] As they crowded there in the doorway, they saw the gaping holes along the walls where the instruments had been inserted, one by one, each to tell its own story of conditions in space. The senator pushed himself into the room and looked about him. Even he could tell the room had been dismantled. ""What kind of sabotage is this?"" he exclaimed, and turned in anger toward Jennings. No one answered him."
2006,"You are directed to clear the area immediately. Maintain fifty miles an hour for the next mile. You may resume desired speeds and change lanes at mile Marker 95. I repeat, all cars in green lane...."" he went over the instructions once more, relayed through Beulah's transmitter to the standard receivers on all cars. He was still talking as the traffic began to move. By the time he turned back to help his teammates, cars were moving in a steady stream past the huge, red-flashing bulk of the patrol car. [SNIPPET] Now ain't that something,"" he whispered in awe.  Hetty started as though someone had snapped their fingers in front of her staring eyes. Her normal look of practical dubiousness returned.  ""Huh,"" she snorted. "" Even had me fooled for a second. Something wrong with this egg but it sure is shootin' ain't gold. One of them fool hens must of been pecking in the fertilizer storeroom and got herself an overdose of some of them minerals in that stuff."
2007,"Three exhausting trips later, he sat among the bodies of his friends, listening with joy to their returning quiver of breath and life. Zina was the first to open her eyes. She seemed startled to find she was no longer on the slab, and then joyous when her glance fell upon his eager face. ""We've done it!"" she sighed. "" We came through!"" She tried to sit up, then lay down heavily. "" [SNIPPET] All those other times ... his unreasoning panic, the askance remarks from Arnold, the humiliation ... the very thought of it now was gibing and obscene. How could he ever have been caught up in such a thrall of terror? It wasn't terror he felt now. Something.... His smile turned to a giggle as he felt a sudden compelling impulse to pat ECAIAC on the head! Now how would one do that? Never mind. Never mind, never mind, never again are you going to snap at me, Ekky."
2008,"The Army had made elaborate plans for what they called ""Operation Sinker."" Even as the general spoke the publicity mills ground into high gear. From coast to coast the citizens absorbed the news with their morning nourishment. ""... Agnes, you hear what the radio said! The Army's gonna give a trip around the world in a B-36 as first prize in this limerick contest. All you have to do is fill in the last line, and mail one copy to the Pentagon and the other to the Navy ..."" [SNIPPET] But we will not be denied forever. It took an entire planet working together to get me on Mars to learn your secrets. And when I got here, I found that I wouldn't have time to learn. We had forgotten one simple thing—my skin color."
2009,"""Where was she found?"" asks Eru. ""Near the p-p-pole of an uninhabited planet—maybe I shouldn't say where because that may be secret, but the rest's History if you know where to look."" Maybe the colonel approves this discretion; anyway his face thaws very slightly unless I am Imagining it. ""Gilgamesh crashed,"" he says. "" [SNIPPET] A shelving beach can be deduced from contour and occasional boulders big enough to stick through the snow that smothers it all. A sort of mess of rocks and mud at the back may be glacial moraine. Over the sea the ice is split in all directions by jagged rifts and channels; the whole thing is a bit like Antarctica but nothing is high enough or white enough to uplift the spirit, it looks not only chilly but kind of mean. ""This place,"" says the colonel, ""is the only one, about which we have any topographical information, that seems to meet the requirements. Got to know about it through an elementary planetography."
2010,"“Wouldn’t do any good. No light down there, and they’re moving up fast.” “Keep an eye on them, but don’t ignore the other sectors,” said Stetson. “You think I was born yesterday?” barked the voice from the grid. [SNIPPET] Yet, his first loyalty belonged to the I-A, to the peace it represented. He said rather lamely: ""I hope you get over the feeling that I'm strange."" ""I'm over it already,"" she said. She linked arms with him, said: ""If you feel up to it, I'll take you on the deluxe guided tour."" By nightfall, Orne was in a state of confusion. He had found Diana fascinating, and yet the most comfortable woman to be around that he had ever met. She liked swimming, paloika hunting, ditar apples— She had a ""poo-poo"" attitude toward the older generation that she said she'd never before revealed to anyone."
2011,"He yelled again, ""Food!"" The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She pointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child. [SNIPPET] Guldran's pulse leaped. He yelled again, ""Food!"" The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She pointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child. ""Food!"""
2012,"I answered I was afraid of it when I left them there, and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island but that they were not come back, that I might have put them in possession of everything first, and left the others in a state of subjection, as they deserved; but if they had reduced them to it I was very glad, and should be very far from finding any fault with it; for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned villains, and were fit for any manner of mischief. While I was saying this, the man came whom he had sent back, and with him eleven more. In the dress they were in it was impossible to guess what nation they were of; but he made all clear, both to them and to me. First, he turned to me, and pointing to them, said, “These, sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you;” and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon which they all came up, one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and the like, but really as if they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or great conqueror: their behaviour was, to the last degree, obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well became them; and, in short, they had so much more manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to return them in kind. The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island after my going away is so very remarkable, and has so many incidents which the former part of my relation will help to understand, and which will in most of the particulars, refer to the account I have already given, that I cannot but commit them, with great delight, to the reading of those that come after me. In order to do this as intelligibly as I can, I must go back to the circumstances in which I left the island, and the persons on it, of whom I am to speak. [SNIPPET] The dog-keeper is said to be an allusion to the Apocryphal book of Tobit. [78a] Dread hell and subdue their lusts. [78b] Strained glosses and interpretations of the simple text. [79a] Images in churches. [79b] The locking up of the Gospel in the original Greek or in the Latin of the Vulgate, and forbidding its diffusion in the language of the people."
2013,"For some reason he had felt sure of Barbara; for another reason he saw no chance with Peggy. She was not the same sort—she was different. She was—well, she was Peggy.  Occasionally his reflections assumed the importance of calculations. His cruise was sure to cost $200,000, a princely sum, but not enough. [SNIPPET] The period of convalescence was to be an exceedingly trying one for the invalid. At first he was kept in-doors, and the hours were whiled away by playing cards. But Monty considered ""bridge"" the ""pons asinorum,"" and preferred to play piquet with Peggy. It was one of these games that the girl interrupted with a question that had troubled her for many days. "" Monty,"" she said, and she found it much more difficult than when she had rehearsed the scene in the silence of her walks; ""I've heard a rumor that Miss Drew and her mother have taken rooms at the hotel. Wouldn't it be pleasanter to have them here?"""
2014,"At first I found them in the moist valley of the river, but very soon they were equally abundant on the higher lands, and even on barren, stony places, where they appeared latest. I felt very curious about these flowers, of which Yoletta had spoken so enthusiastically, and watched the slow growth of the long, slender buds from day to day with considerable impatience. At length, in a moist hollow of the forest, I was delighted to find the full-blown flower. In shape it resembled a tulip, but was more open, and the color a most vivid orange yellow; it had a slight delicate perfume, and was very pretty, with a peculiar waxy gloss on the thick petals, still, I was rather disappointed, since the name of ""rainbow lily,"" and Yoletta's words, had led me to expect a many-colored flower of surpassing beauty.  I plucked the lily carefully, and was taking it home to present it to her, when all at once I remembered that only on one occasion had I seen flowers in her hand, and in the hands of the others, and that was when they were burying their dead. They never wore a flower, nor had I ever seen one in the house, not even in that room where Chastel was kept a prisoner by her malady, and where her greatest delight was to have nature in all its beauty and fragrance brought to her in the conversation of her children. The only flowers in the house were in their illuminations, and those wrought in metal and carved in wood, and the immortal, stony flowers of many brilliant hues in their mosaics. [SNIPPET] It was growing dark now, and how welcome that obscurity seemed, while with no one nigh to see or hear I kissed her soft tresses a hundred times, and murmured a hundred endearing words in her sleeping ears.  Her waking, which gave me a pang at first, afforded me in the end a still greater bliss.  ""Oh, how dark it is—where am I?"" she exclaimed, starting suddenly from repose.  ""With me, sweetest,"" I said. "" Do you not remember going to sleep on my breast?""  ""Yes; but oh, why did you not wake me sooner?"
2015,"or “Pray step into the next room, madam, where the wife of one of our staff will attend you,” or “Pray allow me to slip this penknife of mine into the lining of your coat” (after which he would extract thence shawls and towels with as much nonchalance as he would have done from his own travelling-trunk). Even his superiors acknowledged him to be a devil at the job, rather than a human being, so perfect was his instinct for looking into cart-wheels, carriage-poles, horses’ ears, and places whither an author ought not to penetrate even in thought—places whither only a Customs official is permitted to go. The result was that the wretched traveller who had just crossed the frontier would, within a few minutes, become wholly at sea, and, wiping away the perspiration, and breaking out into body flushes, would be reduced to crossing himself and muttering, “Well, well, well!” In fact, such a traveller would feel in the position of a schoolboy who, having been summoned to the presence of the headmaster for the ostensible purpose of being given an order, has found that he receives, instead, a sound flogging. [SNIPPET] I pledged myself, of course, to all. With an uneasy look in his eyes, and hands unsteady with drink and nervousness, he drew a small case from his breast and opened it. Heavens! How the mild lamplight was shivered into a thousand prismatic arrows, as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond that glittered in the case! I was no judge of diamonds, but I saw at a glance that this was a gem of rare size and purity. I looked at Simon with wonder, and—must I confess it?—with envy."
2016,"Twice Constans had caught him fairly with his binoculars, and he could not be mistaken in the features and carriage of his friend. His friend—one might say the only friend that he had ever had—and Constans felt his heart heavy within him, knowing that they must henceforth walk on diverging paths. Constans found it difficult to keep his men under discipline. It was all-important that their presence should be unsuspected by the enemy, but it would have been betrayed a score of times had not his vigilance intervened. Red Oxenford, in particular, grew more and more unmanageable; he had neither eaten nor slept now for three days, and the strain was telling on him. Finally he announced that he would wait no longer. [SNIPPET] Then I got to thinking that maybe you wouldn't care to come down at nine o'clock, especially as you are just recovering from the joy of being married, so I settled with the lawyers and they'll settle with you. If you have nothing in particular to do this afternoon about two o'clock, I'd suggest that you come to the hotel and we'll dispose of a few formalities that the law requires of us. And you can give me some lessons in spending money. I've got a little I'd like to miss some morning. As for your ability as a business man, I have this to say: Any man who can spend a million a year and have nothing to show for it, don't need a recommendation from anybody. He's in a class by himself, and it's a business that no one else can give him a pointer about. The best test of your real capacity, my boy, is the way you listed your property for taxation."
2017,"And they had never meant to use them! Anger fought with caution. He felt peculiarly helpless now, locked up in his own body like a prison. "" What are you going to do?"" he scrawled. ""Nothing that will hurt, Master,"" said Luke. "" [SNIPPET] He noted their passage in the telescreen, marked their apparent courses, and blithely set himself to land on the one that seemed to be nearest. He was totally ignorant of orbits; he simply centered his planet on the screen as he had done with the star, found that it was receding from him, and began to run it down. He came in too fast the first time—tore through the atmosphere like a lost soul and frantically out again, sweating in the control room's sudden heat. He turned, out in space, and carefully adjusted his speed so that ship and planet drifted softly together. Gently, as if he had been doing this all his life."
2018,"""I'll go over these with my attorney to-night, and mail one back to you if he approves the contract. In the meantime, we may as well get down to business."" ""What would you suggest?"" asked Brookings. ""You people stole the solution, I see...."" ""Don't use such harsh language, Doctor, it's...."" ""Why not? [SNIPPET] All those floods of energy were released instantaneously, of course. “Look—there come the Lanorians now. I want to go back to Sonor and think over this problem. Perhaps we can find something that will release all that energy—though honestly, I doubt it.” Arcot seemed depressed, overawed perhaps, by the sheer magnitude of the force that lay bound up in the Kaxorian ship. It seemed inconceivable that the little Solarite could in any way be effective against the incredible machine. The Lanorian planes were landing almost like a flock of birds, on the wings, the fuselage, the ground all about the gigantic ship."
2019,"A spaceship's too small to make enemies in. ""Suppose you get married,"" I asked him. "" So you have a place to go, and a girl in it, in one port. How about all the others? Going to take a permanent port watch instead of seeing a little fun?"" ""Easy,"" Garrity said. "" [SNIPPET] When he came up for retirement, he was broke. He doesn't complain, but he never has anything left out of his retirement pay. Spends his time loafing around and writing his memoirs. It was women, mostly; after he lost my mother—she died when I was born—he went off to space again. Sent back enough to keep me, spent the rest in one port or another."" I didn't say anything, but it was beginning to add up. I don't know anything about psychology, but I thought there might be something like a reason in what Garrity was telling me for the way Garrity was."
2020,"With a determination of finding a room from which I could command a longer view of Mars, the next day I visited several studios which were for rent, and finally succeeded in securing one formerly occupied by a photographer, which was located on the top floor of a house in the immediate vicinity of my old rooms. The room was large, in fact it occupied the entire top floor of the building, and this feature pleased me greatly. The only communication with the house was by a door which had every appearance of an outside door, so heavy were the hinges and lock. [SNIPPET] Slowly, reluctantly, his fingers uncurled. He arose, to meet the gleaming opening of the Viceroy's weapon, and the surprised stare in back of it. Urga got up groggily, feeling gingerly the tender point of his jaw. There was unfathomable hatred in his lidless eyes."
2021,"They had apparently come up out of the barren rock hillside to view the sunset. I studied them through the telescope while Split checked over equipment for a hike. The man's walk was unhurried. He moved thoughtfully, one might guess. His bare chest and legs showed him to be statuesque in mold, cleanly muscled, fine of bone. [SNIPPET] A thousand nightmares. Space ships shooting through meteor swarms. Stars like eyes. Eyes like stars. The eyes of Vauna, the daughter of Tomboldo. The sensitive stroke of Vauna's fingers, brushing my forehead, pressing my hand."
2022,"He took firm hold of the magazine, as though the miracle might slip between his fingers, and dashed off with more energy than he had felt in months. He found Lavra in the hydroponic room. "" I have just found,"" he shouted, ""the damnedest unbelievable—"" ""Darling,"" said Lavra, ""I want some meat."" ""Don't be silly. We haven't any meat. Nobody's eaten meat except at ritual dinners for generations."" [SNIPPET] the green button. How many buttons could a wood poke poke if a wood poke would poke. ""The breakfast didn't seem to agree with him, doctor."" ""Maybe it was the paper. Makes me run a temperature every morning, too!"""
2023,"Down, so that any observer will know you're armed but not attacking. Hoskins, you'll be in the lock with the outer port open by that time. When Johnny gives the all clear, you'll jump out and put your back against the hull by the port. Then you'll both stay where you are until you get further orders. Is that clear?"" ""Aye."" [SNIPPET] Harry Folsom administered the coup de grace at coffee next morning. "" What you need is an Ego Prime,"" he said with a grin. "" Solve all your problems. I hear they work like a charm."" I set my coffee cup down. Bells were ringing in my ears. "" Don't be ridiculous."
2024,"Then he experimentally turned the handle—to the right until it clicked faintly, then the left, around twice, another faint click, but different, a left-hand click, he knew somehow. So he turned again to the left, this time three turns—and then the click was heavy, almost audible. He pulled the handle and a door formed out of the carpet, swinging easily open. Just then, Joseph peered behind the couch. "" Boo!"" Adam jumped into the opening, the heavy door slamming shut overhead. Below, he stood erect and was surprised to feel the hair on his head brush the ceiling. [SNIPPET] It's going with us. I'm not taking any chances on Marscorp refusing to ferry our cargo back and forth at Mars."" ""Is plotted, Jonner,"" boomed Qoqol, turning his head to peer at them with huge eyes through the spidery tangle of his thin, double-jointed arms and legs. He reached an eight-foot arm across the deck and handed Jonner his figures. Jonner gave them to T'an. ""Figure out power for that one, T'an,"" ordered Jonner, and took his seat in the cushioned control chair. T'an pulled a slide rule from his tunic pocket, but his black almond eyes rested quizzically on Jonner."
2025,"He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows down to the ground what he ‘might’ do. That’s what he gave them a taste of at school.”  “Lord, you do change!” [SNIPPET] It was only a question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which the attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just drive desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till dinner? That would be in a couple of hours, at the end of which—I had the acute prevision—my little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my nonappearance in their train.  “What did you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the world, to worry us so—and take our thoughts off, too, don’t you know?—did you desert us at the very door?”"
2026,"At these words of Merlin, Aurelius burst into laughter, and said, “How is it possible to remove such vast stones from so great a distance, as if Britain, also, had no stones fit for the work?”  “I pray the king,” said Merlin, “to forbear vain laughter; what I have said is true, for those stones are mystical and have healing virtues. The giants of old brought them from the furthest coast of Africa, and placed them in Ireland while they lived in that country: and their design was to make baths in them, for use in time of grievous illness. For if they washed the stones and put the sick into the water, it certainly healed them, as also it did them that were wounded in battle; and there is no stone among them but hath the same virtue still.”  When the Britons heard this, they resolved to send for the stones, and to make war upon the people of Ireland if they offered to withhold them. [SNIPPET] And as he was about to plunge in and swim after, he saw a knight upon the other side, who cried, “Come not over here, Sir knight, after that hart, save thou wilt joust with me.”  “I will not fail for that,” said Sir Gawain; and swam his horse across the stream.  Anon they got their spears, and ran against each other fiercely; and Sir Gawain smote the stranger off his horse, and turning, bade him yield.  “Nay,” replied he, “not so; for though ye have the better of me on horseback, I pray thee, valiant knight, alight, and let us match together with our swords on foot.”  “What is thy name?”"
2027,"Four times he had covered the distance between Salt Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he was facing the same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart was not in the work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid and frightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.  Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all things, without order or discipline. [SNIPPET] “Come, come, Job,” I said seriously, “this is all nonsense, you know. You mustn’t be silly enough to go getting such ideas into your head. We’ve lived through some queer things, and I hope that we may go on doing so.”  “No, sir,” answered Job, in a tone of conviction that jarred on me unpleasantly, “it isn’t nonsense. I’m a doomed man, and I feel it, and a wonderful uncomfortable feeling it is, sir, for one can’t help wondering how it’s going to come about. If you are eating your dinner you think of poison and it goes against your stomach, and if you are walking along these dark rabbit-burrows you think of knives, and Lord, don’t you just shiver about the back! I ain’t particular, sir, provided it’s sharp, like that poor girl, who, now that she’s gone, I am sorry to have spoke hard on, though I don’t approve of her morals in getting married, which I consider too quick to be decent."
2028,"""Oh yes, certainly! I tell you, brother, according to the flesh: it is just as complete as the lark's is with the adder, no more so, nor ever can. Reconciled, forsooth! To what would I be reconciled?""  As he said this, he strode indignantly away. From the moment that he heard his life was safe, he assumed his former insolence and revengeful looks—and never were they more dreadful than on parting with his brother that morning on the top of the hill. "" [SNIPPET] “I am always to be found at the Medina Palace.”  “You may depend upon hearing from me. Farewell, Cavaliers. Segnor Condé, let me entreat you to moderate the excessive ardour of your passion: However, to prove to you that I am not displeased with you, and prevent your abandoning yourself to despair, receive this mark of my affection, and sometimes bestow a thought upon the absent Leonella.”  As She said this, She extended a lean and wrinkled hand; which her supposed Admirer kissed with such sorry grace and constraint so evident, that Lorenzo with difficulty repressed his inclination to laugh. Leonella then hastened to quit the Church; The lovely Antonia followed her in silence; but when She reached the Porch, She turned involuntarily, and cast back her eyes towards Lorenzo."
2029,"""I'll see about that."" Brewster sprang to the door. It was locked and the key was in ""Subway"" Smith's pocket. With an impatient exclamation he turned and pressed an electric button.  ""It won't ring, Monty,"" explained ""Subway."" "" The wire has been cut. [SNIPPET] Then he cried triumphantly, ""I can decline to accept grandfather's million.""  ""You cannot decline to accept what is already yours. I understand that the money has been paid to you by Mr. Buskirk. You have a million dollars, Mr. Brewster, and it cannot be denied."""
2030,"George didn't tell me. I—"" She interrupted with details of the operation. The details and list of her other ailments lasted half an hour, during which George drank steadily and I waited for a lull so I could glance at my watch and say something about being late for an appointment. I saw George several times during the next few weeks. Never at his house. [SNIPPET] Read it!"" ""You read it. You won't get me to play its game."" Rajcik laughed nervously and rubbed his hands together, but didn't move. Both men turned to Somers. ""Captain, it's your responsibility."" ""Go ahead, Captain!"""
2031,"Then the rift screamed by him with a demoniac whine and he sank back onto his bench, gasping as the two cloven halves of the strip clanged back together again. He stared at the people around him on the strip and they stared back at him, mildly, unperturbed, and returned to their evening papers as the strip passed through the first local station on the other side of the ""bridge."" Harry Scott sprang to his feet, moving swiftly across the slower strips for the exit channels. He noted the station stop vaguely, but his only thought now was speed, desperate speed, fear-driven speed to put into action the plan that had suddenly burst in his mind. He knew that he had reached his limit. [SNIPPET] The Coroner could think of only the obvious question: ""Why did you kill him?"" ""He was dangerous to us."" ""Whom do you mean by us?"" ""We Martians, who plan to take over your world."" The Coroner was disappointed. A lunatic. But a lunatic can murder."
2032,"""I know,"" said she. ""'Or ever the knightly years had gone With the old world to the grave, I was a king in Babylon And you were a Christian slave.'"" ""Yes, only I was the slave, I think, and you—er—I mean, there goes the roof, and it is an uncommonly good thing for posterity you thought of the trap-door. Good thing the wind is veering, too. [SNIPPET] This is, of course, only a surmise. There are so many things, about which I wonder. Now that I am writing, let me record that I am certain, there is something horrible about to happen. Last night, a thing occurred, which has filled me with an even greater terror, than did the Pit fear."
2033,"It was visibly taller than it had been only a few hours before. The fountain from its top was thicker, now jetting straight up as though wind no longer meant a thing to the fiercely driven column of gas and dust. The darkness was not so complete; patches of red and yellow incandescence showed briefly in the pillar, and glowing sparks rather than black cinders rained back on the steep slopes. Far above, a ring of smoke rolled and spread about the column, forming an ever-broadening blanket of opaque cloud above a landscape which had never before been shaded from the sun. Streamers of lightning leaped between cloud and pillar, pillar and mountain, even cloud and ground. Any thunder there might have been was drowned in the howl of the escaping gas, a roar which seemed to combine every possible note from the shrillest possible whistle to a bass felt by the chest rather than heard by the ears. Rowson's language had become inaudible almost before he had disappeared down the hatch. [SNIPPET] The helicopter began to fall forward. Tom felt Lois' hand on his. ""You haven't answered my question,"" she said. ""What?"" he asked dully. ""Whether you'll stay with us."
2034,"Good boy, Willy."" He accepted Willy's pen. That was the tip they had all been waiting for. Willy, then—Lou's father—was the new favorite. Willy, who looked almost as young as Lou, though he was 142, did a poor job of concealing his pleasure. [SNIPPET] ""Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!"" he said, and he made a joke. "" What are you doing here?"" he said. "" This isn't where the people leave."
2035,"He wheeled quickly, there under the tree, and slowly backed away as the thing drifted in to keep him company in his shelter. We could not see his face, but there was a stiffness to his figure indicating something like fear. Suddenly things I had read rose into my memory. This was one of those objects variously called ""fire-balls,"" ""globe-lightning,"" ""meteors,"" and the like. I also recalled the deadly explosive potencies said to be sometimes possessed by such entities, and called out frantically: [SNIPPET] ""Maybe I'll join up with this outfit. After we've sold the ship I'll see. How does that sound to you?""  ""Wonderful, Hugh,"" Nanlo whispered. "" But I don't care about that."
2036,"My own hair-comb was in love with me, she lost all her teeth from the heart-ache; yes, I have lived to see much of that sort of thing; but I am extremely sorry for the garter—I mean the girdle—that went into the water-tub. I have much on my conscience, I want to become white paper!”  And it became so, all the rags were turned into white paper; but the collar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see, and on which the story is printed; and that was because it boasted so terribly afterwards of what had never happened to it. It would be well for us to beware, that we may not act in a similar manner, for we can never know if we may not, in the course of time, also come into the rag chest, and be made into white paper, and then have our whole life's history printed on it, even the most secret, and be obliged to run about and tell it ourselves, just like this collar.    It is in the hot lands that the sun burns, sure enough! there the people become quite a mahogany brown, ay, and in the HOTTEST lands they are burnt to Negroes. [SNIPPET] There it is, glorious and beautiful!” said the Reindeer. “ One can spring about in the large shining valleys! The Snow Queen has her summer-tent there; but her fixed abode is high up towards the North Pole, on the Island called Spitzbergen.”  “Oh, Kay! Poor little Kay!” sighed Gerda."
2037,"Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life, and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone.  Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all. [SNIPPET] Louise said in a musing tone that she envied the existence of fishes: ""It must be so delightful to tumble about down there at your ease, and to feel yourself caressed on every side."" She shivered with sensuously enticing movements;[59] but a voice exclaimed: ""Where are you?"" ""Your maid is calling you,"" said Frederick."
2038,"No place can be better than ours, and I have nothing to wish for!”  “Yes,” said the dame. “ I would willingly go to the manorhouse, be boiled, and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been treated so; there is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!”  “The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!” said Father Snail. “ Or the burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out. [SNIPPET] I wish they would reinsert in the Memoirs of La Campan the suppressed paragraphs. The death of the Dauphin appears to me equivocal. The powder magazine at Grenelle by exploding killed two thousand persons. The cause was unknown, they tell us: what nonsense!"" For Pécuchet was not far from understanding it, and threw the blame for every crime on the manœuvres of the aristocrats, gold, and the f In the mind of Bouvard there could be no dispute as to the use of the words, ""Ascend to heaven, son of St. Louis,"" as to the incident about the virgins of Verdun, or as to the culottes clothed in human skin."
2039,"""You want to get there, don't you?"" Jon turned away indifferently, while Mrs. Carver smiled at Jak and shrugged. During the balance of that ""day"" Jon stayed in the control room. When either of the others looked in, he was studying intently. Right after breakfast the next morning he put in a long session at the computer and his drawing board, then after lunch went into the storeroom. After a while he came out with his arms filled with wires, cells, relays and other oddments, which he carried into the control room. [SNIPPET] ""And under the Prime Discoverer's code, we'll get a percentage of the process, won't we, Pop?"" ""I think so. That'll be up to the Board, but they're usually pretty square about such things."" When it was time, Jak again gave the family the dosages of nutrients, and then the shots. Jon had filled four thermos bottles with strength-regaining soup his mother had made, and these were placed at each pressure-pack, ready for their awakening."
2040,"You would have failed signally to convince the Mind Master in the role of an African great ape.” Bentley managed a short laugh. How horribly it came from the lips of an ape! “I’m not overly superstitious,” he said, “but I regard this as a good omen. I feel we’re sure to succeed in what we are planning. I think Barter will surely wish to experiment with me if he thinks I am in reality a great ape from Colombia. He’ll welcome the chance to examine any ape which so nearly resembles man. [SNIPPET] It was still impossible for me to feel that it was unreal, it had been so vivid, so clear. I remember that I lived nearly two months—or so it seemed—in that other world. I was assigned an apartment near to Edvar's—Selda was between us. Edvar instructed me in the details of the life I was to lead. But he was a rather cold sort: his interests were ancient history and archeology, and he would spend his mornings at work in the Library of History or in his[Pg 36] study, the rest of his time flying about the world on curious expeditions of discovery—examining the soil, I suppose, and investigating the customs and records of other cities. Selda devoted most of her time to me. It was she who took me from place to place, showing me the natural beauties of that world."
2041,"No one at all."" The patterns shifted and darkened. "" Then I must be getting careless. I am growing old."" ""Anyone can make a slip,"" Mattern said reassuringly. "" Just try to be a little more careful, that's all."" [SNIPPET] A man felt as if he were being twisted and wrenched apart, and it didn't hurt, and it was the wrongness of that more than anything else that—well, that was why the pay was so high on the starships. So many of them went mad. All this Len Mattern had heard of and had expected—though no amount of expectation could have braced him for that kind of reality. But there was more to it than he had heard, and it was the extra part that the second officer seemed curiously anxious to deny. """
2042,"He found himself repulsive. His body perspired freely impregnating the ape skin with a harsh odor that was biting and terrible in his nostrils. It was sickening. He tried to close his mind to the repulsiveness of what he was doing. [SNIPPET] Oh, there are plenty of pictures extant of the famous Professor Caleb Barter who disappeared from the world some years ago, but he’ll know that, of course, and he won’t look like the pictures. “Alteration of his own features should be easy for a man who juggles brains.” “He may have changed his features since I saw him, too,” said Bentley. “ But I’m sure I’d know him.” Tyler’s telephone rang stridently."
2043,"""Oh?"" ""Yes. What's more, they were mammals."" ""Mammals? [SNIPPET] He himself favored the mass hysteria theory. But if you looked at his gobbledegook closely, you could reduce it to one phrase, We don't know. ""He did say this—though you won't like it—that the schizos and the transies were just two sides of the same coin. Both were infected with the same disease, whatever it was. And the transies usually ended up as schizos anyway. It just took them longer."""
2044,"I require the blood of fifty of the most beautiful sons of thy vizirs and great men, or neither can my thirst nor thy curiosity be satisfied. Return to Samarah, procure for me this necessary libation, come back hither, throw it thyself into this chasm, and then shalt thou see!” Having thus spoken, the Indian turned his back on the Caliph, who, incited by the suggestion of demons, resolved on the direful sacrifice. He now pretended to have regained his tranquillity, and set out for Samarah amidst the acclamations of a people who still loved him, and forbore not to rejoice when they believed him to have recovered his reason. So successfully did he conceal the emotion of his heart, that even Carathis and Morakanabad were equally deceived with the rest. [SNIPPET] I hobble on—I'm out of wind— And still they leave me far behind! To find peace here in vain I come, I get no more than I left at home. Chorus of witches. The witch's salve can never fail, A rag will answer for a sail, Any trough will do for a ship, that's tight; He'll never fly who flies not to-night. Both chorusses."
2045,"Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres. No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions: Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water as needed. [SNIPPET] ""I will not!"" the Butcher countered hotly. "" I'm not going to be a sissy."" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. "" And what if we were attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?"" ""The Space Fleet would take care of them,"" Hal replied calmly. "" That's what it's for."
2046,"I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this morning blew it to hell and gone. ""And I've got to find out how it happened."" Thurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little doctor. ""Where's that girl you said was in charge of this place?"" ""We've already called for Miss Abercrombie and she's on her way here now,"" the doctor snapped. [SNIPPET] My name, dear—just my name!"" Her mouth moved; she grew pale with effort and Dan could have sworn that his name trembled on her quivering lips, though no sound came. At last she spoke. "" I can't, dearest one! Oh, I can't!"
2047,"A real one; not one of these night-school boys. A juvenile psychologist, too. And what age-group spends the most money in this country for soft-drinks?"" Knowing the names of the syrup's ingredients, and what their molecular structure was like, was only the beginning. [SNIPPET] You've made a mistake, that's what you've done."" He stood there, hesitating. The girl gave a burst of laughter. Then she said: ""All right, Sweetheart. I'll turn my back."" She did, and he pulled his shirt out of his trousers."
2048,"Presently he came upon a stile, and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward. He passed near several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn. He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers. He came upon them just in time to save them.  He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened pony’s head. One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand. [SNIPPET] He listened with an air of deep distrust when told how an amateur had driven his car and with absorbed interest to the few sentences in which our experiences of the sleeping city were recorded. I can remember his comment when the story was concluded.  ""Was you outside the Bank of England, sir?""  ""Yes, Austin."""
2049,"He yelled again, ""Food!"" The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. [SNIPPET] ""You stay here with us, Bet,"" said Lucy. "" You parked your copter in our port, didn't you? Frank, I think we need a drink."" I pushed the buttons. Nobody said anything, but somehow it was a toast to Hal. I know the liquor had to get past a lump in my throat and the women were both crying."
2050,"So did SK540. But to him health was taken for granted; freedom was freedom from cages, traps, cats, and dogs; wealth meant shelter from cold and rain and plenty to eat; love meant a constant supply of available females. But power! It was in his longing for power that he most revealingly displayed his status as super-rat. Therefore, once he had learned how to open his cage, he was carefully selective of the companions—actually, the followers—whom he would release to join his midnight hegira from the laboratory. Only the meekest and most subservient of the males—intelligent but not too intelligent—and the most desirable and amiable of the females were invited. [SNIPPET] Then they seize that person, and kill him or her, slowly and painfully, before the thief's eyes. And the agreement had been that The Eel was to be tried and punished by the laws and customs of the planet to which he was awarded. The actual trial and conviction of The Eel were almost perfunctory. Without needing to resort to torture, his jailers had been presented, on a platter as it were, with a full confession—so far as the particular robbery he had committed on Agsk was concerned. There is a provision for defense in the Agskian code, but it was unneeded because The Eel had pleaded guilty."
2051,"‘“Jove!” he began abruptly, “there are days when a fellow is too absurd for anything; only I know I can tell you what I like. I talk about being done with it—with the bally thing at the back of my head . . . Forgetting . . . Hang me if I know! I can think of it quietly. [SNIPPET] And so these last days and nights were glorious ones, if one could have looked at them with unbiased, untroubled eyes. But every member of his party was praying for the day when the ""Flitter"" would be well into the broad Atlantic and the worst over. At Alexandria Brewster had letters to some Englishmen, and in the few entertainments that he gave succeeded once again in fairly outdoing Aladdin.  A sheik from the interior was a guest at one of Monty's entertainments. He was a burly, hot-blooded fellow, with a densely-populated harem, and he had been invited more as a curiosity than as one to be honored. As he came aboard the ""Flitter,"" Monty believed the invitation was more than justified. Mohammed was superb, and the women of the party made so much of him that it was small wonder that his head was turned."
2052,"""You're junior to all the others, for one thing. And besides, you'll still be around to see Boy America grow up."" ""Boy America?"" ""Each year there will be a new contest; a boy the first year, a girl the second and so on. [SNIPPET] I don't know what to do."" He poured another drink and downed it. ""George,"" Gloria wailed, her control breaking at last, ""I don't want a test-tube husband, a parent by proxy. I want a man!"" She began to cry. He came over to the couch and dropped down beside her. "" Darling, please!"
2053,"On an impulse he ordered the cabbie to draw up to the curb and purchased a newspaper. “Do you mind if I glance through the headlines?” Bentley asked Ellen. “ I haven’t looked at an American paper for ever so long.” The cab started again and Bentley folded the paper, falling easily into the habit of New Yorkers who are accustomed to reading on subways where there isn’t room for elbows, to say nothing of broad newspapers. [SNIPPET] He turned and left the room without a farewell, which was a measure of his agitation. I sat there behind my desk wondering what the Niobians could do. Like my ex-boss Alvord Sims, I had a healthy respect for them. It just could be that they could do plenty."
2054,"""At ease with that jazz,"" said Lane, and a sheathed finger snapped out. There was a loud bang. The 3V screen dissolved into a puddle of glasstic. The Mayor. Lane strode to the window. [SNIPPET] Spurling turned. The Hat Rat saw him. ""The enemy!"" the Hat Rat shouted."
2055,"He saw Mrs. Burroughs was a little nervous about his experimenting in the guest room and he assured her it was not dangerous. Before the week was out, we started hearing the noises. The first one was like a wire brush going around a barrel. It went whisk, whisk. [SNIPPET] Bonnie held her nose, stood on tiptoe and looked in at the cooking solution. "" Will this make us healthy?"" ""Maybe."" Bob kept stirring. ""What will it do?"" ""You'll see."" Bob took two clean dish towels, draped them around the pot and carried it over to the formica kitchen table."
2056,"What do we then?""  Then spake Jack of the Tofts: ""This is well thought of by Haward of Whiteacre, and we must look to it. And, by my rede, we shall have our women and little ones with us; and why not? For we shall then but be moving Toftstead as we move; and ever to some of us hath it been as a camp rather than an house. Moreover, ye know it, that our women be no useless and soft queans, who durst not lie under the oak boughs for a night or two, or wade a water over their ankles, but valiant they be, and kind, and helpful; and many of them are there who can draw a bow with the best, and, it may be, push a spear if need were. How say ye, lads?""  Now this also they yea-said gladly; forsooth they had scarce been fain of leaving the women behind, at least the younger ones, even had they been safe at the Tofts; for there is no time when a man would gladlier have a fair woman in his arms than when battle and life-peril are toward. [SNIPPET] “Oh,” Conseil put in, “there are some people so unintelligent by nature . . .” As he was saying these words, the door opened. A steward entered.* He brought us some clothes, jackets and sailor’s pants, made out of a fabric whose nature I didn’t recognize. I hurried to change into them, and my companions followed suit."
2057,"He gave a concise description of the wounds which had killed my predecessor. Sidney was trying to make something out of the fact that he was Hickock's family physician, and consuming more time, when I got up. ""Your Honor, I am present here as amicus curiae, because of the obvious interest which the Government of the Solar League has in this case...."" ""Objection!"" Sidney yelled. ""Please state it,"" Nelson invited. [SNIPPET] Altamont looked at the thing dubiously, then filled his pipe from it. The oldster drew his pistol, pushed a little wooden plug into the vent, added some tow to the priming, and, aiming at the wall, snapped it. Evidently, at time the formality of plugging the vent had been overlooked: there were a number of holes in the wall there. This time, however, the pistol didn't go off. The old man shook out the smoldering tow, blew it into flame, and lit a candle from it, offering the light to Altamont."
2058,"Here on Vesta, this had been the issue he had faced all along. In many ages and many nations—and probably on many planets throughout the universe—others had faced it before him. To his straining and tortured mind the trite and somewhat mocking answers came: Psychology. Salesmanship. The selling of respect for one's self. Ah, yes. [SNIPPET] I weigh on the edge of the stretcher and tilt it up to get it over the obstacle. With the antigrav full on it keeps its momentum and goes on moving up. I try to check it, but the wind gets underneath. It is tugging to get away; I step blindly upwards in the effort to keep up with it."
2059,"I needed the space. They were too good to cut up. No one would buy them. So I sent them up. The newspapers—"" [SNIPPET] So well spread were they, that within minutes headquarters had laid four lines over Southern California. They crossed where the unsuspecting community of Fullerton was more or less sound asleep, totally unaware of the making of history in its back yard. The history of what astronomers call Solomon's Orbit had its beginning about three months ago. Solomon, who couldn't remember his first name, was warming tired bones in the sun, in front of his auto-wrecking yard a mile south of Fullerton. Though sitting, he was propped against the office; a tin shed decorated like a Christmas tree with hundreds of hub caps dangling from sagging wooden rafters. The back door opened on two acres of what Solomon happily agreed was the finest junk in all California."
2060,"I guess I was tired, at that. When I wake I feel more cheerful than I have for weeks; analysis indicates I am glad something is happening even if it is another Exam. I dial breakfast but am too restless to eat; I wonder how long this goes on or whether I am supposed to show Initiative and break out; I am examining things with this in mind when the speaker comes to life again. It says, ""Ladies and gentlemen. You have not been told whether the problem that you studied yesterday concerned a real situation or an imaginary one. [SNIPPET] The colonel takes up the paper, folds it in half and puts it down one inch further away. ""The hopper's crew,"" he says, ""will give the whole game away should one of them fall into Incognitan hands, alive or dead. Therefore they don't take any risks of it."" He lifts his gaze ceilingwards. """
2061,"Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts of ironwork, they had without reserve, as they required; for no man would take more than he wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on any account whatever; and for the use of the smith I left two tons of unwrought iron for a supply. My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; for now they could march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if there was occasion; and were able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but some little advantages of situation, which also they could not miss, if they had occasion. I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved to death, and the maid also; she was a sober, well-educated, religious young woman, and behaved so inoffensively that every one gave her a good word; she had, indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the ship but herself, but she bore it with patience. After a while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my island, and considering that they had neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or reason for taking so long a voyage, both of them came to me and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to this readily; and they had a little plot of ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed like Atkins’s, adjoining to his plantation. [SNIPPET] After a long debate, it was agreed that they should be disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any weapon; that they should be turned out of the society, and left to live where they would and how they would, by themselves; but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should hold any kind of converse with them, or have anything to do with them; that they should be forbid to come within a certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and if they offered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society, they should die without mercy, and they would shoot them wherever they could find them. The humane governor, musing upon the sentence, considered a little upon it; and turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, “Hold; you must reflect that it will be long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we must therefore allow them provisions.” So he caused to be added, that they should have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time they might be supposed to raise some of their own; that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and six kids given them, as well for present subsistence as for a store; and that they should have tools given them for their work in the fields, but they should have none of these tools or provisions unless they would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow-Englishmen. Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to shift for themselves."
2062,"Of the poets whom we may term ""rising"", none presents a more striking figure than Ira A. Cole of Bazine, Kansas. Previously well known as a prose writer and publisher, he made his debut as a metrist just a year ago, through a very beautiful piece in the heroic couplet entitled ""A Dream of the Golden Age"". Mr. Cole is one of the few survivors of the genuine classic school, and constitutes a legitimate successor to the late Georgian poets. His development has been of extraordinary rapidity, and he will shortly surprise the amateur public both by a poetic drama called ""The Pauper and the Prince"", and by a long mythological poem not unlike Moore's ""Lalla Rookh"". The natural and pantheistic character of Mr. Cole's philosophy adapts him with phenomenal grace to his position as a mirror of classical antiquity. [SNIPPET] ""Treasure Trove,"" by Henry Cleveland Wood, is a pleasant and urbane bit of light verse; while ""Percival Lowell,"" by Howard Phillips Lovecraft, is an abominably dull elegiac piece of heavy verse. Edwin Gibson's ""Sonnet to Acyion"" deserves keen attention as the work of a capable and rapidly developing young bard. "" Real versus Ideal"" is a bright metrical divertissement by John Russell, which suffers through the omission of the opening line by the printer. This line is:"
2063,"""Sit down, gentlemen,"" the Toon Leader invited, going to a cupboard and producing a large bottle stopped with a corncob and a number of small cups. "" It's a little early in the day,"" he said, ""but this is a very special occasion. You smoke a pipe, I take it?"" he asked Altamont. "" Then try some of this; of our own growth and curing."" [SNIPPET] The problem is to make them understand that."" I nodded again. "" And an attack by the z'Srauff would do that, too, sir,"" I said. Natalenko tittered again. """
2064,"Until long after midnight he smoked and calculated and dreamed. For the first time the immensity of that million thrust itself upon him. If on that very day, October the first, he were to begin the task of spending it he would have but three hundred and fifty-seven days in which to accomplish the end. Taking the round sum of one million dollars as a basis, it was an easy matter to calculate his average daily disbursement. The situation did not look so utterly impossible until he held up the little sheet of paper and ruefully contemplated the result of that simple problem in mathematics. [SNIPPET] Your father, too, was a man of learning as befitted his position; no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner or the speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember) I took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and those of my own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire, Campbell of Minch, and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure in his society. Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before you, here is the testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own hand of our departed brother.”  He gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words: “To the hands of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these will be delivered by my son, David Balfour.” My heart was beating hard at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen years of age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of Ettrick."
2065,"""We came to at the same time, and he went into the galley to fix up something to eat."" ""Good for him!"" exclaimed Dorothy. "" I'm simply starved to death. I would have been demanding food long ago, but I have so many aches and pains that I didn't realize how hungry I was until you mentioned it. [SNIPPET] What do you think of trying indirect action in the shape of Perkins, who is indirection personified?"" ""Bring him in. He may be able to figure out something."" Perkins was called in, and the main phases of the situation laid before him. The three men sat in silence for many minutes while the crafty strategist studied the problem. Finally he spoke."

[SNIPPET] Upon his seeming decease, his friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit it. As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private. Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private hospitals.  An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen, when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an application of the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and the customary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any respect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the convulsive action.  It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient, at length, to proceed at once to the dissection."
2067,"In fact, standing there so frank and anxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic, which made it much worse. ""Of course, there are several more convincing alternate explanations...."" Theodor began hesitantly, knowing very well that there weren't. If Phobos and Deimos had suddenly disintegrated, surely Mars Base would have noticed something. Of course there was the Disordered Space Hypothesis, even if it was little more than the chance phrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist. [SNIPPET] And it must be he; he had said that he had seen the beasts himself. Well, Dodeth would have to find out. ""Tool users, eh?"" he said, amazed at the calmness of his voice."
2068,"she exploded. "" Doesn't that blob of black sparklers know that growing boys need food to grow!"" ""There's no need to be redundant!"" said the Martian. ""To what?"" she cried, standing back from the cage to glare at him the better, with arms akimbo. [SNIPPET] They reassured him solemnly. ""Terra has no real need of the crystals. We can offer a tested genetics program that will eliminate racial anxiety within a few generations, and supply neural therapy equipment—on a trade basis, of course—that will serve the crystals' purpose during the interim."" There should be a flaw somewhere, Jeff felt, but he failed to see one. He gave up trying when he found Jennifer eying him with uncharacteristic uncertainty."
2069,"Political maneuvering was not his problem, that was between Pentagon and Congress. ""We must have his support, Jim,"" the general explained. "" Pentagon hasn't been able to win him over. He's stubborn and violent in his reactions. The fact it keeps him in the headlines—well, of course that wouldn't have any bearing. So Pentagon invited him to come to the field here to watch the test, hoping that would win him over."" [SNIPPET] Jennings swerved the jeep off the dirt road and took out across the hummocks of sagebrush to the ship a few rods away. He hardly slacked speed, and in a swirl of dust pulled up to the side of the ship. Before it had even stopped, the men were piling out of the jeep, running toward the side of the ship. And stopped short. ""Well, well, what's holding us up?"" he panted irritably. Cautiously then, Jennings moved toward the open door."
2070,"Suddenly the cat jumped from his lap and seemed to pounce on some elusive prey in the room. The cat caught what it was seeking, its jaws crunched, it swallowed. Thompson stared at the cat from disbelieving eyes. "" Buster, are you dreaming? [SNIPPET] Without needing to resort to torture, his jailers had been presented, on a platter as it were, with a full confession—so far as the particular robbery he had committed on Agsk was concerned. There is a provision for defense in the Agskian code, but it was unneeded because The Eel had pleaded guilty. But he knew very well he would not be executed by the Agskians; he would instead be set free (presumably with a broken heart) to be handed over to the next claimant—and that, the Council had decided, would be Medoris. Since Medoris always kills its criminals, that would end the whole controversy."
2071,"These means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. It should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of sea-water; nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds. These means, however, would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to another. The floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great degree; but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be. [SNIPPET] and, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive at the word ‘tree,’ as the sole possible reading. We thus gain another letter, r, represented by (, with the words ‘the tree’ in juxtaposition.  “Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see the combination ;48, and employ it by way of termination to what immediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:  the tree ;4(‡?34 the,  or, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:  the tree thr‡?3h the."
2072,"I cannot leave him. Eagle Feather needs him. We will be safe here, and comfortable, and at peace.[497] She would send for Eagle Feather. [SNIPPET] Look, you come over here for something, or just to gab? I got a lot of work to do."" Barrows looked weary and worried. "" Them brown beetles is at my crop again,"" he said. "" Thought you might know some way of getting rid of them."" ""Sure,"" said Rankin. "" Pick them off, one by one."
2073,"He reached out and touched the small hands on each side of the mother and the feeling for which there were no words came through more strongly than ever before. Tiny voices tried to whisper within the corners of his mind, partially blotted, sometimes heard. The real things, the things of hate and fear and despair retreated beyond the bugle call that sounded somewhere. ""She will die,"" the voice said; one voice for two. "" [SNIPPET] The squawking of the launch radio roused Ellis. He groaned and sat up, dazed and disoriented by the combined shock of Xaxtol’s telepathic bombshell and his own rude landing, just as Weyman gave up his attempt at radio contact. In the silence that fell, Ellis would have fainted again except for the chilling knowledge that he was unarmed and afoot on the same key with a man-eating alien monster that might make its appearance at any moment. He collected wits and breath to stave off the black pall of shock that still threatened. “Come down from there and help me push the launch off,” he called up to Charlie Trask. “ We’ve got to get off this key."
2074,"When they went out their chief design was plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them all. When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought had been the town, which was not above half a mile off, they were under great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses, and where the town was, or how big, they knew not. They consulted, therefore, what to do, and were some time before they could resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut all their throats; and it was ten to one but some of them might escape, it being in the night, though the moon was up; and if one escaped, he would run and raise all the town, so they should have a whole army upon them; on the other hand, if they went away and left those untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not tell which way to look for the town; however, the last was the best advice, so they resolved to leave them, and look for the town as well as they could. They went on a little way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this, they presently concluded, would be a good guide to them; for, they said, the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, or the town behind them, and if they untied her, they should see which way she went: if she went back, they had nothing to say to her; but if she went forward, they would follow her. [SNIPPET] The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good; and as the winds had continued in the points between NE. and SE. a long time, we missed several opportunities of sending them to France; for we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher’s, but they had been so long beating up against the wind that they durst take in no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this that we made the banks of Newfoundland; where, to shorten my story, we put all our French people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, if they could get provisions to victual themselves with. When I say all the French went on shore, I should remember that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed to, for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as will appear afterwards; also four of the seamen entered themselves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows. From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind at all; when we met with another subject for our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before."
2075,"And now it was even more detestable to my ears, recalling as it did too vividly the cruel events of the preceding evening.  ""John must be sitting up playing,"" I said.  ""Yes,"" she answered; ""but why is he in this part of the house, and why does he always play that tune?""  It was if some irresistible attraction drew us towards the music. Constance took my hand in hers and we moved together slowly down the passage. [SNIPPET] The ponderous bolts grated into place. The lock clicked. I have never seen Captain John Carter, of Virginia, since.  But here is the story of his return to Mars on that other occasion, as I have gleaned it from the great mass of notes which he left for me upon the table of his room in the hotel at Richmond.  There is much which I have left out; much which I have not dared to tell; but you will find the story of his second search for Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, even more remarkable than was his first manuscript which I gave to an unbelieving world a short time since and through which we followed the fighting Virginian across dead sea bottoms under the moons of Mars.  E. R. B"
2076,"I must be Co., I must. I’ve often thought,’ he added, in a low voice, ‘as I should like to know a Co.; but I little thought as ever I should live to be one.’  ‘You shall have your own way, Mark.’  ‘Thank’ee, sir. If any country gentleman thereabouts, in the public way, or otherwise, wanted such a thing as a skittle-ground made, I could take that part of the bis’ness, sir.’  ‘Against any architect in the States,’ said Martin. ‘ Get a couple of sherry-cobblers, Mark, and we’ll drink success to the firm.’ [SNIPPET] Both light and heat could diffuse themselves in the air. Hence there was equilibrium between the influences which no longer exists now that the atmosphere has almost entirely disappeared. Besides, I shall astonish you—"" ""Astonish us?"" said Michel Ardan. ""But I believe that at the epoch when the moon was inhabited the nights and days did not last 354 hours!"" ""Why so?"""
2077,"The track was slippery—Marta Lami and the three they had released from the cage room, unshod. Sherman gripped her by the hand. "" Hurry, oh, hurry,"" he panted, pulling her along. They passed another passage, down which a door stood open. [SNIPPET] Only Gloria had thought of this and withheld her fire. The others swung round as she shot and in an instant the whole group was a maze of whirling wings, clutching claws, shouts, shots and screams. In twenty seconds it was done: Gloria and Murray rose panting and breathless, and looked about. Beside them, two gigantic bird-forms were spilling their lives in convulsive agony. Dangerfield and Farrelly were gone—and a rending screech from behind the buildings told only too well where."
2078,"""Come now, Peggy, that is too much.""  ""I didn't mean to hurt you. But you must not forget, Monty, that there are other years to follow this one. Do you know what I mean?"" [SNIPPET] You see, we neither of us know how to cook."" I wondered what they would say to William's cooking, but I held my peace and retired, leaving the little brook to mirror the sweetest face that was ever bathed in water."
2079,"Dat one dam bully dog! Eh? How moch?”  “Three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater. “ And seem’ it’s government money, you ain’t got no kick coming, eh, Perrault?”  Perrault grinned. [SNIPPET] ""Of course,"" stiffly punctilious, ""only,"" his eyes were still hard and stormy, ""was it important enough to break mother's heart?"" The older man's voice grew soft and shook with genuine emotion. "" You and everyone had to believe that, Spence, all these years. I've been prayerfully waiting for the day when I could explain to you. I can assure you, Son,"" with all the sincerity his voice could carry, ""that she did not die of a broken ..."" ""I know bet ..."" ""You do not know better!"""
2080,"Even if he is mad, I will follow him and die with him. The thought occurred to him that if Baibars should fall—God forbid!—then he would have to lead these fifteen thousand men. For a moment he was seized by fear, whether of his lord's death or of having to lead alone, he was not sure. Baibars saw the disbelief of his officers. "" [SNIPPET] demanded Peo. "" There is no evidence of any such situation."" ""The evidence is well hidden. But if you think your stomach can take it now, I'll tell you. If you remember your history, colonizing ships 1000 years ago had no space to carry animals along. They had to depend on native animal life of the planet, and this planet had none."" ""Saranta said that."
2081,"The storm, which I had feared might prove disastrous, had been passed through safely, and now reigned the wonderful quiet of Mars. The strange uneasiness, which I had experienced upon my departure from Earth, was forgotten in the anticipation of the great joy before me, or I would have noticed that the usual calm, ever characteristic of Almos, was lacking. It was already past the hour of my appointment with Zarlah, and, eager to be with her, I hastily made the necessary preparations for my return to Earth. Although these consisted merely of changing the current so that it would flow from the virator to Earth, and adjusting the clockwork for the hour of departure, I had decided upon the importance of doing this beforehand, as any mistake made in the haste of departure would prove fatal to either Almos or myself. [SNIPPET] I but came to ask the indulgence of another day since it would be fool-hardy to attempt to navigate a ship in such a storm.""  ""Remain, Gahan, a welcome guest until you choose to leave us,"" replied The Warlord; ""but you must forgive any seeming inattention upon the part of Helium until my daughter is restored to us.""  ""You daughter! Restored! What do you mean?"" exclaimed the Gatholian. "" I do not understand."""
2082,"We're on my expense account. The resources of the Federated States of all The Americas stand behind your menu."" Alcala smiled. "" I wouldn't want to add to the national debt."" ""Not at all, Senor. The Federated States are only too happy thus to express a fraction of their gratitude by adding a touch of luxury to the otherwise barren and self-sacrificing life of a scientist."" [SNIPPET] He turned and shouted up at the truncated steeple: ""Atherton, sound 'All Clear!'"" A horn, up in the belfry, began blowing, to advise the people who had run from the fields into the woods that there was no danger. They went through the open doorway of the old stone church, and entered the big room inside. The building had evidently been gutted by fire, two centuries before, and portions of the wall had been restored. Now there was a rough plank floor, and a plank ceiling at about twelve feet; the room was apparently used as a community center. There were a number of benches and chairs, all very neatly made, and along one wall, out of the way, ten or fifteen long tables had been stacked, the tops in a pile and the trestles on them."
2083,"John Andrew gasped and started sinking again. To find himself hauled out of the water unceremoniously by the scruff of his neck. As he rose, ropy tentacles twined about him, and he saw what had saved him. He was being cradled, gently but firmly, by the nonapus, which had Judge Ray in another set of tentacles. And the nonapus, it became apparent, was not only a water-creature. It could also fly. [SNIPPET] The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him from the shack. There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere and cameras clicking. For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay and photographed it from every angle."
2084,"""The terror which this demonstration of the strength of the party of social discontent caused among the possessing class seems at this distance rather remarkable, seeing that its demands, while attacking many important capitalist abuses, did not as yet directly assail the principle of the private control of capital as the root of the whole social evil. No doubt, what alarmed the capitalists even more than the specific propositions of the social insurgents were the signs of a settled popular exasperation against them and all their works, which indicated that what was now called for was but the beginning of what would be demanded later. The antislavery party had not begun with demanding the abolition of slavery, but merely its limitation. The slaveholders were not, however, deceived as to the significance of the new political portent, and the capitalists would have been less wise in their generation than their predecessors had they not seen in the political situation the beginning of a confrontation of the people and the capitalists--the masses and the classes, as the expression of the day was--which threatened an economic and social revolution in the near future."" ""It seems to me,"" I said, ""that by this stage of the revolutionary movement American capitalists capable of a dispassionate view of the situation ought to have seen the necessity of making concessions if they were to preserve any part of their advantages."" ""If they had,"" replied the doctor, ""they would have been the first beneficiaries of a tyranny who in presence of a rising flood of revolution ever realized its force or thought of making concessions until it was hopelessly too late. [SNIPPET] I stood for some time silently looking about me. I saw that my companion was furtively regarding me with an expression of awed and sympathetic curiosity. I put out my hand to her and she placed hers in it, the soft fingers responding with a reassuring pressure to my clasp. Finally she whispered, ""Had we not better go out now?"
2085,"Quick as a great cat Conan caught up Olivia and ran. Through the shadows he raced like a phantom, while somewhere above and behind them sounded a curious rushing among the leaves, that implacably drew closer and closer. Then the moonlight burst full upon their faces, and they were speeding up the slope of the plateau. At the crest Conan laid Olivia down, and turned to glare back at the gulf of shadows they had just quitted. The leaves shook in a sudden breeze; that was all. [SNIPPET] She smiled at him. ""I would be very pleased."" ""Good. You can call me Jennie."" ""Thanks."" ""Then you are enjoying your vacation."""
2086,"It is allowed to run wild about the gardens and fields, developing its bodily powers in play, and gaining a practical experience of the most elementary facts. After that it goes to school, at first for a short time, then, as it becomes used to the confinement and study, for a longer and longer period each day. Their end in education is to produce noble men and women; that is to say, physical, moral, and intellectual beauty by assisting the natural growth. They hold it a sin to falsify or distort the mind, as well as the soul or body of a child. They seem to be as careful to cultivate the genius and temperament as the heart and conscience. Their object is to train and form the pupil according to the intention of Nature without forcing him beyond his strength, or into an artificial mould. [SNIPPET] Gravity is rather less there than it is here. Like Mercury, she appears to have a cloudy atmosphere, and very high mountains. On the whole she resembles the earth, but is, perhaps, a younger as well as a warmer planet. ""The green ball, next to Venus, is, I need hardly say, our own dear little world."
2087,"Dogs stirred, yapping at sudden activity they alone knew of, then nose to tail, returned to sleep when threats of intrusion failed to materialize. The sun was barely up when the chicken farmer was stopped a block from his house, Highway patrolmen slowly inspected his truck from front to back, while three cars full of civilians, by the side of the road, watched every move. Finding nothing unusual, a patrolman reported to the first civilian car then returned to wave the farmer on his way. When the widow teacher from the frame house, started for school, she too, was stopped. After a cursory inspection the patrolman passed her on. Two of the three accounted for. What of the third? [SNIPPET] They left guards posted inside the fence of Solomon's yard, so they'll cause no attention while protecting his property. A rugged individual sits in the office and tells buyers and sellers alike, that he is Solomon's nephew. "" The old man had to take a trip in a hurry."" Because he knows nothing of the business, they'll have to wait until Solomon returns."
2088,"The raps followed us as we went through the hall, sounding on the balusters, the flooring, and even the lintels of the door. I hastily expressed my satisfaction, and escaped hurriedly into the cool night air. I walked home with but one thought possessing me—how to obtain a diamond of the immense size required. My entire means multiplied a hundred times over would have been inadequate to its purchase. Besides, such stones are rare, and become historical. I could find such only in the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs. [SNIPPET] In another minute or two the squeaking of the axle ceased, as the waggon reached the storehouses, and he immediately returned to the pillow. Without, and just beneath the window, there ran a road or way, which in part divided the enclosure into two portions; the dwelling-house and its offices being on one side, the granaries and storehouses on the other. But a few yards to the left of his room, a strong gate in the enclosing wall gave entrance to this roadway. It was called the Maple Gate, because a small maple tree grew near outside."

2090,"The reversed singer faded out, to give place to an earnestly grinning announcer who pointed emphatically to a large, upside down sign bearing the name of a product. ""Watching it this way could get to be a fad,"" the repairman said, at last, almost inaudibly. He fell silent again, and Mr. Rapp, sadly, began to realize that even this bearded and confident young man had apparently been stopped, like the others. ""The way I look at it, like, there's a place where science hangs up,"" the bearded one spoke, finally. [SNIPPET] (The old man paused in the utter silence, while several tears dropped down his cheek. None of Them moved, and at last he went on.) Near the end of the ten years, I received a package from him in the mail. In it was a letter and the manuscript to the Storm in Space Overture. He wanted me to register the work and get the government fee, and he asked me the only favor he had ever asked of anyone, that I get him the money, because he was going into space. He came back some weeks later, on foot."
2091,"It was roughly pyramidal, with a base about sixty feet thick. It would do. ""Kemp."" The private hurried to his side. "" Take the torch and make us a cave. Make it big enough for the entire crew and the equipment."" Kemp was a good Planeteer. [SNIPPET] The slave twisted in his bonds, screaming again. Rhythmic shudders jerked at his limbs. His lips turned greenish white. The shudders grew more pronounced till it seemed as though he were afflicted with a sort of horrible St. Vitus dance. Then the tall Rogan pulled back the lever. The slave hung away from his supporting shackles, limp and unconscious. Dex moistened his lips."
2092,"Flame-propelled by their shoulder-pack jets, they darted downward toward the sad, rolling hills that curved away under the weak light of the distance-shrunken sun. It was hard to believe that eons ago, before most of Titan's air and water had leaked away into space, those hills had been green with life. Even with an ugly, red-lit vapor pouring and spreading over the arc of Titan's edge, they thought of such things. heir helmet radiophones were full of static from intense electromagnetic disturbances, so that it was hard to converse. But presently Alice shouted: ""Bert! [SNIPPET] The Kumaji'll kill me for a renegade, I figure. I lived a good, long life. I've no regrets. Go after your people, young fellow. They'll need every extra strong right arm they can get. You got any weapons?"" ""No,"" Steve said."
2093,"“Anyway, this bird stepped straight out of the wall as if it had been a waterfall or something, but the wall itself was undamaged. The only proof I had that he had actually done it was the fact that he was in my office, but that was proof enough. “To put it mildly, I was thunderstruck. After jumping to my feet, I could only stand there like an idiot. I was so shaken that I couldn’t speak a word. But he spoke first. [SNIPPET] A single plane of atoms, at the base of the treated object is the point of contact. It remains partially unaffected because it is closest to the ‘gravetostatic field center’, which I guess is the Earth’s center of attraction. This plane of ‘semi-treated’ atoms can be forced through an object, if it is moved horizontally, but its ‘untreated’ aspect prevents the subject wearing the device from falling through the floor. “Busch demonstrated this device to me, turning it on and strolling through various objects in this room."
2094,"Well, well. Are you sure Busch told you everything?” “Busch! He honestly wants to help and we have taken him through the mill. Pentathol, scopolamine and the like; hypnotism and the polygraph. We’ve dug that man deeper than we have ever dug anybody before.” “And have you conducted any experiments of your own?” [SNIPPET] But the Crew was part of the ship. Was not there an obligation even greater to keep the Crew going? The four others lived but almost imperceptibly in some very low state of slowed metabolism there in the bunkroom and Kelly looked at them. The faithful and the wonderful ones. The ones with whom he had shared so many dangers and awful silences that the five of them had been able to evolve the idea of the protoplasm in the tank and merge their consciousness in it. Kew, the Venusian, in her bowl of self-renewing nitrate. Lakrit from a Jovian satellite, a fluorine fellow of distinction inside a sphere of gaseous sulphur."
2095,"Sir John was saying, and Alice, too, was saying something, but I cannot remember what. For a long while we talked, I speaking the nonsense of those who are coming out from under ether, they teasing me a little solemnly. But after a little while I became aware of the fact that they were about to leave. Suddenly, God knows why, I knew that they must not leave. Something cried in the back of my head that they must stay—one cannot explain these things, except by after events. I began to press them to remain, but they smiled and said they must get their dinner. I commanded them not to go; but they spoke kindly and said they would be back before long. [SNIPPET] Don nodded seriously. "" Yes, sir. And what you just said is true. I couldn't be used any longer in a Scout. I'd wind up selling bonds and giving talks to old ladies' clubs.""

2096,"he wondered. He'd broken no laws in all the years he'd been in the United States. "" For what do they bother a wrecking yard?"" he asked himself. His depressing thoughts were rudely shattered by a hail from the larger civilian, standing at the back of Solomon's yard. There, three old cars stood in an isolated row. "" Solomon, come here a moment,"" he shouted. [SNIPPET] Then on second thought, he decided not to show them to him. Travail was getting on his nerves. He had obviously lied about his interest in shells. On discussing the subject with him Sutter found he did not know the first thing about them. In fact, he regretted taking him in as a roommate. He was convinced that Travail's friendly good-fellowship attitude was just a pose, cloaking a so far mysterious motive. But it could be that Travail knew of the value of Sutter's shell collection."
2097,"""How can such a thing be possible?"" returned Zarlah, in tremulous accents, drawing closer to me as the awfulness of our narrow escape appalled her. ""Ah, my love, we may never know that!"" I answered. "" The Great Creator of all these wonders has, indeed, guided us to this haven in our wild flight through space. We can but theorize that the pole, being several miles in diameter, hurled us from its edge, the tremendous repelling force not permitting our aerenoids to proceed over its surface. The rotary motion of the planet upon its axis would then cause us to describe a curve in our flight from its surface, as only in the center of the pole would this rotary motion lose its effect."" [SNIPPET] ""Farley!"" Blaine shouted. "" He is alive?"" A wild hope sprang into being, intensified to a certainty as Dantor nodded."
2098,"We'll have a party! Helen's changed. You should see her!"" I was interested in his problem, so I went. Helen greeted me at the door and I had the surprise of my life. At one time, she had been beautiful, but she had faded during the past few years. [SNIPPET] I don't know how we could get there. But if a way could be found—"" ""Venus?"" George inquired. "" The colony your father started?"" ""Yes. There are only a few colonists there—not more than twenty-five."
2099,"Beyond the lighted chamber of the lake was darkness—what lay behind the darkness I could not even guess.  To have followed the thern boat across the gleaming water would have been to invite instant detection, and so, though I was loath to permit Thurid to pass even for an instant beyond my sight, I was forced to wait in the shadows until the other boat had passed from my sight at the far extremity of the lake.  Then I paddled out upon the brilliant surface in the direction they had taken.  When, after what seemed an eternity, I reached the shadows at the upper end of the lake I found that the river issued from a low aperture, to pass beneath which it was necessary that I compel Woola to lie flat in the boat, and I, myself, must need bend double before the low roof cleared my head. [SNIPPET] ""This is the end, then?"" ""Not yet,"" he replied in a calm and level voice. "" The end will not come for a good many hours, as I have calculated that it will take at least two days, probably more, to fall the distance we have to go. We have all that time in which to think out a way of escape."" ""Won't the outer repulsive shell keep us from striking it, or at least break the force of our fall?"""
2100,"Ghip-Ghisizzle was to have been my mate, but Ghip escaped, being carried away by the Six Snubnosed Princesses.""  ""Why?"" she asked.  ""One of them means to marry him,"" explained Tiggle.  ""Oh, that's worse than being patched!"" cried Trot. [SNIPPET] That you may fully understand that marvelous battle, I must confide to, you a great secret. I have in my possession three Magic Talismans, which I have ever guarded with utmost care, keeping the knowledge of their existence from anyone else. But, lest I should die, and the secret be lost, I have decided to tell you what these talismans are and where they are hidden. Come with me, my son."""
2101,"But truly, Mattern, a madman would not seek to reach us."" ""I wonder,"" Mattern said. "" I wonder if anybody but a madman would."" This time he had displeased her. [SNIPPET] Now let me point out the two plants you'll miss badly. One is yeast. Yes, yeast. When you read this, the one-celled organisms responsible for wine, beer, and alcohol generally, will be dying as a race. In a few months, good liquor will be scarcer than an electric blanket in hell. Sure, grain alcohol can be synthesized, but bouquet isn't that simple, and you'll pay dearly for it—how you'll pay!—and decent lab-made whiskey won't be on the shelves tomorrow, either."
2102,"""But, Dennell, you are too hasty. You must not put yourself so rashly into my hands."" ""You have perfected the operation, haven't you?"" ""That is true,"" he said. ""You must try it out on somebody, must you not?"" [SNIPPET] Broke and famous. And laughed at probably in the bargain."" ""Nothing of the kind. We could write our own ticket. We'd control the gateway to the greatest mineral deposits within reach of Man! Think of it, Lee. Use your imagination."""
2103,"The muttering was now very definitely spaced into irregular but continuous tones. And he knew that he was listening to a conversation. He was frightened. Now that he was so near to what he had been seeking, his courage left him; and he lay trembling, flat on the ground, awed by the booming voices of the creatures. [SNIPPET] Hello,"" said Solomon to the patrolman, while opening the door. "" Why you bother me so early? You know I only buy cars from owners."" ""No, Mr. Solomon, we're not worried about your car buying. This man, from Washington, wants to ask you a few questions."" ""Sure, come in,"" Solomon replied."
2104,"""I hadn't thought of that. Yes, I'd say it was pretty close to the Brightside route. It wouldn't be practical for you to stop your run now to come back to see. You couldn't do much about it anyway. I could go out to have a look and then report to you. If the way back is blocked there'll be plenty of time to work out another."" Hargedon and Zaino passed questioning glances at each other during the shorter pause that followed. [SNIPPET] Streamers of lightning leaped between cloud and pillar, pillar and mountain, even cloud and ground. Any thunder there might have been was drowned in the howl of the escaping gas, a roar which seemed to combine every possible note from the shrillest possible whistle to a bass felt by the chest rather than heard by the ears. Rowson's language had become inaudible almost before he had disappeared down the hatch. For long moments the radioman watched the spreading cloud, and wondered whether the Albireo could escape being struck by the flickering, ceaseless lightning."
2105,"The sixteen Earth hours that the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either. Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, ""If I were you, Junior, I would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth. If we get back to Earth,"" he amended. "" You can't be Four's father. All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the polarizer will polarize it."" ""That's just supposition,"" Junior said stubbornly. "" [SNIPPET] At best, he was on unfamiliar ground, with a dozen factors that could go wrong. By now the patient was a dreadful risk for any surgeon. If he were to step in now, and the patient died, how would he explain not calling for help? He stepped out to the scrub room where Tiger was waiting. "" Where's Jack?"""
2106,"The others, one’s neighbors, le prochain, as you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil. Le prochain—your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.”  And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He evidently wished to draw him on. [SNIPPET] He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to himself—“You mustn’t be excited, you must be calm. What’s the matter with you? What do you want? Be quiet, stupid,” he conjured his heart."
2107,"The ash is light, especially here, but there's a mile and a half of dam to be built. I don't see how it can possibly be done ... but it's going to be."" ""Come on, Arnie! You're young and strong,"" came the voice of the mineralogist. "" You should be able to lift as much of this stuff as I can. I understand you were lucky enough to get hold of Eileen—have you asked for the bonus yet?—but your work isn't done."" ""It wasn't luck,"" Zaino retorted. [SNIPPET] With noticeable haste they floundered through the loose ash a few yards above the base until they had outdistanced the glowing menace, descended and started back across the plain to where they knew the ship to be, though she was invisible through the falling detritus. Once they had to detour around a crack. Once they encountered one which widened toward the chasm on their right, and they knew a detour would be impossible. Leaping it seemed impossible, too, but they did it. Thirty seconds after this, forty minutes after finding the tractor destroyed, the landscape was bathed in a magnesium-white glare as the two one-and-a-half kiloton charges planted just inside the crater rim let go. ""Should we go back and see if it worked?"""
2108,"Lord Grenville turned in search of the Comtesse, who sat at the further end of the room.  “Lud love me!” whispered His Royal Highness to Marguerite, as soon as he had caught sight of the rigid figure of the old lady; “Lud love me! she looks very virtuous and very melancholy.”  “Faith, your Royal Highness,” she rejoined with a smile, “virtue is like precious odours, most fragrant when it is crushed.”  “Virtue, alas!” [SNIPPET] But, astonished though he was, he was able to make a polite bow before the throne and to say in a respectful voice: ""I salute your Illustrious Majesty and offer you my humble services.""  ""Very good!"" answered the Tin Woodman in his accustomed cheerful manner. "" Tell me who you are, and whence you come.""  ""I am known as Woot the Wanderer,"" answered the boy, ""and I have come, through many travels and by roundabout ways, from my former home in a far corner of the Gillikin Country of Oz.""  ""To wander from one's home,"" remarked the Scarecrow, ""is to encounter dangers and hardships, especially if one is made of meat and bone."
2109,"Fie, be frightened!"" cried the laird. "" Fie, rin like fools, as if ye were caught in an ill-turn!"" His bride was not among them; so he was obliged to betake himself to further search. "" She will be praying in some corner, poor woman,"" said he to himself. "" It is an unlucky thing this praying. [SNIPPET] But scarce was this done ere the portentous strength of the Black Knight forced his way inward in despite of De Bracy and his followers. Two of the foremost instantly fell, and the rest gave way notwithstanding all their leader’s efforts to stop them.  “Dogs!” said De Bracy, “will ye let TWO men win our only pass for safety?”  “He is the devil!” said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from the blows of their sable antagonist.  “And if he be the devil,” replied De Bracy, “would you fly from him into the mouth of hell?—the castle burns behind us, villains!—let despair give you courage, or let me forward!"
2110,"said he, when he saw what was going on, and he boxed the Princess's ears with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking the eighty-sixth kiss.  “March out!” said the Emperor, for he was very angry; and both Princess and swineherd were thrust out of the city.  The Princess now stood and wept, the swineherd scolded, and the rain poured down.  “Alas! [SNIPPET] I’ll get a passport, two passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable people.... If you like, I’ll take a passport for you... for your mother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love you beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let me.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, ‘do that,’ and I’ll do it. I’ll do everything."
2111,"And his arms, still vigorous in spite of fatigue and suffering, closed round Marguerite’s poor, weary body, and lifted her as gently as if she had been a feather.  Then, as Sir Andrew discreetly kept out of earshot, there were many things said—or rather whispered—which even the autumn breeze did not catch, for it had gone to rest.  All his fatigue was forgotten; his shoulders must have been very sore, for the soldiers had hit hard, but the man’s muscles seemed made of steel, and his energy was almost supernatural. It was a weary tramp, half a league along the stony side of the cliffs, but never for a moment did his courage give way or his muscles yield to fatigue. On he tramped, with firm footstep, his vigorous arms encircling the precious burden, and . . . no doubt, as she lay, quiet and happy, at times lulled to momentary drowsiness, at others watching, through the slowly gathering morning light, the pleasant face with the lazy, drooping blue eyes, ever cheerful, ever illumined with a good-humoured smile, she whispered many things, which helped to shorten the weary road, and acted as a soothing balsam to his aching sinews.  The many-hued light of dawn was breaking in the east, when at last they reached the creek beyond Gris Nez. [SNIPPET] But there was no time now to go over the past. By her own blindness she had sinned; now she must repay, not by empty remorse, but by prompt and useful action.  Percy had started for Calais, utterly unconscious of the fact that his most relentless enemy was on his heels. He had set sail early that morning from London Bridge. Provided he had a favourable wind, he would no doubt be in France within twenty-four hours; no doubt he had reckoned on the wind and chosen this route."
2112,"What if I get sick?"" ""You can't get sick. There's aspirin and vitamins in it, too."" Bonnie sighed and wrinkled her nose. "" Well, here goes,"" she said. [SNIPPET] When he had squeezed the last drop of oil out of the can, he ate all the sardines and tossed the can into the sink. Bonnie went after the salt and, when she lifted out the box, she found a package containing two chocolate graham crackers. ""Mom has a new hiding place, Bob,"" she announced. Bob looked up. "" Where is it?"""
2113,"Again came Olaf's voice:  ""The stone—it is open—"" And then a shriek, a wail of blended anguish and pity, of rage and despair—and the sound of swift footsteps racing through the wall beneath me!  I dropped to the ground. The moon door was wide open, and through it I caught a glimpse of a corridor filled with a faint, pearly vaporous light like earliest misty dawn. But of Olaf I could see—nothing! [SNIPPET] How did you escape? I was just thinking of unlocking your door, Monty, but the key seemed to be missing.""  Peggy displayed it triumphantly.  ""By Jove,"" cried Dan. "" This is rank treachery. Who was on guard?"""
2114,"Nevertheless, the prisoner did not struggle or strive to break his bonds. Was he cowed by the presence of these men, whom he had once resembled? Was there in some corner of his brain a flitting remembrance which drew him towards humanity? Free, would he have fled or would he have remained? They did not know, and they did not put him to the proof. After having looked attentively at the miserable creature, Spilett said:—  “What he is, what he has been, and what he will be; it is still our duty to take him to Lincoln Island.” [SNIPPET] Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood from this official report that our army had been defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kutúzov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son.  “Your son,” wrote Kutúzov, “fell before my eyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of a regiment—he fell as a hero, worthy of his father and his fatherland."
2115,"Schiemann still wasn't convinced that he was not being played for a sucker. Being what he was, he could never expose himself to a court battle, no matter how much justice might be on his side in a particular instance. But he didn't think Len could be so rotten as to figure on something like that. Besides, the old captain couldn't help liking the boy. So he agreed, saying as he did so, ""I should have my head examined."" But before the fourth voyage was out, he realized that he had never done a wiser thing in his life. [SNIPPET] But too late. The bag had disappeared. ""Hey!"" I yelled. """
2116,"His free hand was growing tired from holding the pen. When all the rest was done, Luke would freeze that hand also, and then it would be only a minute or so until he could inject the antidote. He scribbled idly, ""Do you remember the old days, before I came, Luke?"" ""Very well, Master,"" said the apostle. "" But it seems a long time ago."" [SNIPPET] There's a sign for you!"" The man threw himself out of range; but his face, convulsed with pain, held a stunned bewilderment. "" Adric—Narayan promised—you were sane—"" he breathed. I forced my sword back into the scabbard, staring without comprehension at the blood from the wound I had inflicted, and at the darting heads of the flowers. I could not kill this man who carried the name of Narayan on his tongue. The flowers twitched—stirred—threw tendrils at the man's bleeding hand. A quick nausea tightened my throat; I motioned urgently to him."
2117,"None of them were new to me; they were all on file in the Political Survey Division of the United Nations Government on Earth, plus several more which Colonel Brock either neglected to tell me or wasn't aware of himself. But I listened with interest; after all, I wasn't supposed to know any of these things. I am just a plain, ordinary, ""confidential expediter"". That's what it says on the door of my office in New York, and that's what it says on my license. [SNIPPET] The boy on top of the library began scrambling down. Another came running from the direction of the half-demolished Cathedral of Learning, a third from the baseball field that had served as Altamont's point of reference the afternoon before. The fourth, Murray Hughes, was running in from the ruins of the old Carnegie Tech buildings, and Birdy Edwards sped up the main road from Schenley Park. Once, twice, as he ran, Murray Hughes paused, turned, and fired behind him. Then his pursuers came into sight! They ran erect, they wore a few rags of skin garments, and they carried spears and hatchets and clubs, so they were probably classifiable as men."
2118,"And after that, his comments remained largely gibberish for some time. However, he was even quicker than we were to see the need for secrecy—he had vivid visions of the political capital which opposing newspapers would make of any such occurrence at his party—and so we arranged a plan. According to which we drove to the back of the house, explained to the curious who rushed out that Tristan had been injured by a stroke of lightning, and rushed the closely wrapped form up to his room, feeling a great relief at having something solid between us and the sky. While Jack went downstairs to dismiss the party as courteously as possible, Alice and I tied my brother to the bed with trunk straps. [SNIPPET] If he hadn't got in and riled things up, maybe the Swami would not have been emotionally upset enough to generate the psi force which had activated these new cylinders. What was I saying? That psi was linked with emotional upheaval? Well, maybe."
2119,"A friend! Faust. A beast! Mephistopheles. Time flies, I don't offend you? Martha [entering]. [SNIPPET] “Speak,” said he, “where are we? do you not see those spectres that are stirring the burning coals? are they Monker and Nakir, come to throw us into them? does the fatal bridge cross this lake, whose solemn stillness perhaps conceals from us an abyss, in which for whole ages we shall be doomed incessantly to sink?”"
2120,"We ascended the steps, and passing through the portico went into the hall by what seemed to me a doorless way. It was not really so, as I discovered later; the doors, of which there were several, some of colored glass, others of some other material, were simply thrust back into receptacles within the wall itself, which was five or six feet thick. The hall was the noblest I had ever seen; it had a stone and bronze fireplace some twenty or thirty feet long on one side, and several tall arched doorways on the other. The spaces between the doors were covered with sculpture, its material being a blue-gray stone combined or inlaid with a yellow metal, the effect being indescribably rich. The floor was mosaic of many dark colors, but with no definite pattern, and the concave roof was deep red in color. [SNIPPET] Again and yet again that despairing Ah-i-me fell like a long shuddering sob from the revolving globes, and from voices far and near, to be taken up and borne yet further away by far-off, dying sounds, yet again responded to by nearer, clearer voices, in tones which seemed wrung ""from the depths of some divine despair""; then to pass away, but not wholly pass, for all the hidden cells were stirred, and the vibrating air, like mysterious, invisible hands, swept the suspended strings, until the exquisite bliss and pain of it made me tremble and shed tears, as I sat there in the dark, wondering, as men will wonder at such moments, what this tempest of the soul which music wakes in us can mean: whether it is merely a growth of this our earth-life, or a something added, a divine hunger of the heart which is part of our immortality."
2121,"""I don't want my grandfather to die, either,"" said Wehling. ""Nobody's really happy about taking a close relative to the Catbox,"" said Dr. Hitz gently, sympathetically. ""I wish people wouldn't call it that,"" said Leora Duncan. ""What?"" said Dr. Hitz. [SNIPPET] ""I put in another cube and sent it two years back. The second cube came back unchanged, except that it was newer, shinier. ""That gave me the answer. I had been expecting the cubes to go back in time, and they had done so, but not in the sense I had expected them to."
2122,"Back to his work he went; calculating possibilities, eliminating entrants one by one. The National Genetics Laboratory had been given the task of screening the finalists from each state and Turner, much against his will, had been selected by the Director to do the work. ""George,"" he'd said one fateful morning, ""I have a job for you."" ""What's that, sir?"" ""You've seen the report of this new contest being run by Dee Lish Baby Foods, haven't you?"" [SNIPPET] ""Quite sure."" George smiled. "" She's been looking forward to meeting you."" He pulled the car into a spacious port and opened the front door of the house for Harmon."

[SNIPPET] ""We could keep it alive till we're ready to use it. Then it would stay fresh."" ""No, let's kill it. It doesn't look too fresh, even the way it is."" ""Gentlemen, you are making a mistake,"" I said. """
2124,"My love! My love! Yes! day draws near. The day of judgment too will soon appear! It should have been my bridal! [SNIPPET] The father of a family will not then weaken his constitution and debase his sentiments, by visiting the harlot, nor forget, in obeying the call of appetite, the purpose for which it was implanted; and the mother will not neglect her children to practise the arts of coquetry, when sense and modesty secure her the friendship of her husband. But, till men become attentive to the duty of a father, it is vain to expect women to spend that time in their nursery which they, ""wise in their generation,"" choose to spend at their glass; for this exertion of cunning is only an instinct of nature to enable them to obtain indirectly a little of that power of which they are unjustly denied a share; for, if women are not permitted to enjoy legitimate rights, they will render both men and themselves vicious, to obtain illicit privileges. I wish, sir, to set some investigations of this kind afloat in France; and should they lead to a confirmation of my principles, when your constitution is revised, the rights of woman may be respected, if it be fully proved that reason calls for this respect, and loudly demands JUSTICE for one half of the human race. I am, sir, Yours respectfully,"
2125,"But at least I'm not blaming inanimate objects, the way Watkins is. Or permitting myself the luxury of shock, like you."" He studied Somers' face. "" This is your first real emergency, isn't it, Captain?"" ""I suppose so,"" Somers answered vaguely. [SNIPPET] Finally, they were all gone, and the orchestra had gathered up its instruments and filed out into the wings of the stage, and he looked up to the left and said, softly: ""All right, Doug; show's over."" With a soft thud, the big man dropped down from the guard's cubicle overhead, grinning cheerfully. He needed a shave—Yetsko always did, in the mornings—and in his leather Literates' guard uniform, he looked like some ogreish giant out of the mythology of the past. ""I was glad to have you up there with the Big Noise, this morning,"" Prestonby said. """
2126,"If once a man is prejudiced on one side, he will swear anything in support of such prejudice. I tried to expostulate with my mysterious friend on the horrid injustice of suffering this young man to die for our act, but the prince exulted in it more than the other, and said the latter was the most dangerous man of the two.  The alarm in and about Glasgow was prodigious. The country being divided into two political parties, the court and the country party, the former held meetings, issued proclamations, and offered rewards, ascribing all to the violence of party spirit, and deprecating the infernal measures of their opponents. [SNIPPET] What is it, Sir?"" said the laird fiercely.  ""A message of the greatest importance, Sir,"" said the divine, striding unceremoniously up to the chimney, turning his back to the fire, and his face to the culprits. "" I think you should know me, Sir?"" continued he, looking displeasedly at the laird, with his face half turned round."
2127,"If the public suddenly realized that—"" The Coroner broke in. "" You killed Smith because he revealed something in his writings?"" ""Yes. He refused to take my word that it was unsalable. He threatened to submit it direct. It was vital material."" [SNIPPET] I felt the music before it was sung, do you realize that? I felt the fear around me, even though no one said a word. It wasn't vague or fuzzy, it was clear! The transference was perfect."" She turned to face the old man. "" It's taken so long to come this far, Nehmon."
2128,"“One of theirs?” “No. It was a mini off the Delphinus Rediscovery. The Delphinus has[104] been unreported for eighteen standard months!” “Did it crack up here?” [SNIPPET] He looked around the room, then winked. "" See that window?"" I looked. It opened with a slither of wood and a rumble of sash weights."
2129,When we had finished he asked to see our records. Hillyard had them all set down for easy numerical tabulation. Middletown went to work with scarcely a word. Within an hour he had produced a chart that was simply astounding. LATHAM. Can you describe this chart for us? NIEMAND. [SNIPPET] NIEMAND. Middletown was immediately struck by the resemblance between the chart of mental disturbance and one he had been plotting over the years from his radio observations. Now when he compared the two charts the resemblance between the two was unmistakable. The pattern shown by the chart of mental disturbance corresponded in a striking way with the solar chart but with this difference.
2130,"""What in the dickens are you talking about?"" I asked. ""I'm talking about the—the—"" he gulped painfully—""the stage."" Alice wrung her hands, crying bitterly: ""Wonderful! Splendid! [SNIPPET] Thinking that an animal had gotten loose, or something of that kind, I wheeled. Unmistakably the racket came from Tristan's own tent. Cold dread clutching at my heart, and with lead on my boot soles, I rushed frantically back. At the entrance I was held by a mad onrush of humanity for some moments. When I reached the platform, Tristan was not in sight. Then I noticed the long-necked boy sitting on the platform with his face in his hands, shrieking:"
2131,"“What wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy, by outliving and confirming our own predictions; by observing the progress and return of comets, with the changes of motion in the sun, moon, and stars!”  I enlarged upon many other topics, which the natural desire of endless life, and sublunary happiness, could easily furnish me with. When I had ended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted, as before, to the rest of the company, there was a good deal of talk among them in the language of the country, not without some laughter at my expense. At last, the same gentleman who had been my interpreter, said, “he was desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes, which I had fallen into through the common imbecility of human nature, and upon that allowance was less answerable for them. That this breed of struldbrugs was peculiar to their country, for there were no such people either in Balnibarbi or Japan, where he had the honour to be ambassador from his majesty, and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to believe that the fact was possible: and it appeared from my astonishment when he first mentioned the matter to me, that I received it as a thing wholly new, and scarcely to be credited. That in the two kingdoms above mentioned, where, during his residence, he had conversed very much, he observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind. [SNIPPET] He at first objected to my plan as useless, seeing that, owing to the gross ignorance of the people, they could not be brought to profit by the lesson I meant to teach them; and added that, from his knowledge of the country and its customs, he feared we should fall into great peril by giving offence to these brutal idol worshippers. This somewhat stayed my purpose, but I was still uneasy all that day to put my project in execution; and that evening, meeting the Scots merchant in our walk about the town, I again called upon him to aid me in it. When he found me resolute he said that, on further thoughts, he could not but applaud the design, and told me I should not go alone, but he would go with me; but he would go first and bring a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; “and one,” said he, “as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to be against such devilish things as these.” So we agreed to go, only we three and my man-servant, and resolved to put it in execution the following night about midnight, with all possible secrecy. We thought it better to delay it till the next night, because the caravan being to set forward in the morning, we suppose the governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his power. The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for the enterprise as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar’s robe or gown of sheepskins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had provided the same for himself and his countryman, that the people, if they saw us, should not determine who we were. All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter, with aqua vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could get; and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition."
2132,"He jolted suddenly, sickeningly awake. Suppose, his mind whispered treacherously, suppose that Dad had ordered one to take Mom's place ... not on Mars, but here while she returned to Mars with him. Suppose that instead of Mom he discovered one of those Things ... or even worse, suppose he went on from day to day not even knowing. It was a bad five minutes; he was wet with perspiration when he lay back on his pillows, a shaky smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He had a secret defense against the Terror. He giggled a little at the thought of what Aunt Bee would say if she knew. [SNIPPET] Now he slipped his revolver into his waist-belt and writhed out of the coat, shedding the ruined shoulder-holster at the same time. Wriggling on the flat of his back, he squirmed between the rear wheels, until he was able to sit up, behind the jeep. Then, swinging the weighted coat, he flung it forward, over the nighthound and the jeep itself, at the same time drawing his revolver. Immediately, the nighthound, lured by the sudden movement of the principal source of the scent, jumped out of the jeep and bounded after the coat, and there was considerable noise in the brush on the lower side of the railroad grade."
2133,"""I won't do it!"" growled the Old Man. "" I never have and I never will. I don't do things that way. A whisper to one or two, and the business is done, but not a hundred at one time. [SNIPPET] We have our share of trade, but the overhead has become so heavy that we have not been able to make any money lately."" ""That is what I understand,"" commented the stranger. "" In fact, I was sent here by the Chamber of Commerce. They told me you had been paying money for rat protection. That is about the only reason I want to buy your business. Your business is supposed to be worth about two hundred thousand and your real estate as much more."
2134,"M'Clare was just stooping to the fuse, I think. The computer smashed against his legs and pinned him down in the angle between the wall and the floor. His legs are hidden by it. Because of the spacesuit he does not looked crushed; the thick clumsy joints have kept their roundness, so far as they are visible; only his hands and head are bare and vulnerable looking. I am halfway down, floating on minimum gravity, before it really occurs to me that he may be still alive. I switch to half and drop beside him. [SNIPPET] They'll wait another day. Let's do that, then, uh ... Mary."" ""Yes, sir."" Marlowe switched off and picked up a report which he began to read by the page-block system, his eyes almost unblinking between pages. """
2135,"A feeling of wonderment mingled with the horror of the spectators. ""What happened to him?"" asked Marta Lami in a whisper as though she feared awakening a sleeper. Stevens shrugged. "" What's happened to all of us? He's alive, I tell you. [SNIPPET] This one did exactly as the first had done. Stared at him for a moment, then took him by the arm and led him across the room to a machine, where it left him. Sherman perceived that he was supposed to care for it, and with a sigh, bent to his task. It was some moments before the rapid flashing of lights gave him a respite."
2136,"This passage was a fresh revelation to me. Again I recalled Chastel's words, her repeated assurances that she knew what was passing in my mind, that her eyes saw things more clearly than others could see them, that only by giving me the desire of my heart could the one remaining hope of her life be fulfilled. Now I seemed able to understand these dark sayings, and a new excitement, full of the joy of hope, sprang up in me, making me forget the misery I had so recently experienced, and even that increasing sensation of intense cold caused by the draught from the mysterious bottle.  I continued reading, but the above passage was succeeded by minute instructions, extending over several pages, concerning the dress, both for ordinary and extraordinary occasions, to be worn by the chosen daughter during her year of preparation: the conduct to be observed by her towards other members of the family, also towards pilgrims visiting the house in the interval, with many other matters of secondary importance. Impatient to reach the end, I tried to turn the leaves rapidly, but now found that my arm had grown strangely stiff and cold, and seemed like an arm of iron when I raised it, so that the turning over of each leaf was an immense labor. Then I read yet another page, but with the utmost difficulty; for, notwithstanding the eagerness of my mind, my eyes began to remain more and more rigidly fixed on the center of the leaf, so that I could scarcely force them to follow the lines. [SNIPPET] I am tired—tired,"" she murmured. "" Stay with me a little longer, but leave me if I sleep.""  And in a little while she slept. The light was on her face, resting on the purple pillow, and with the soulful eyes closed, and the lips that had no red color of life in them also closed and motionless, it was like a face carved in ivory of one who had suffered like Isarte in the house and perished long generations ago; and the abundant dark, lusterless hair that framed it, looked dead too, and of the color of wrought iron."
2137,"Otherwise she would never have in her hands the threads of her own life, and there would be no life for her. Only the complete loss of self that comes to the Watchers of the Holy Flame. And that is a holy thing, and an honor to one's house, if it is chosen from the heart. But if it is chosen from fear of crossing the passageways of life—then it is no honor but a shame. And Juba knew she could not bear such a shame, either for her house or within the depths of her soul. [SNIPPET] He said uneasily, ""Do you think there's any possibility of it being true?"" ""What?"" asked the secretary guardedly. ""That peculiar hint about Maizie."" The secretary said nothing. ""Mind you, I don't think there is,"" the President went on hurriedly, his face assuming a sorrowful scowl. """
2138,"And she showed them the top of her head with its singed hair and its jagged ring of skull and they took pity. My least plausible theory of me, but the one I like the most, is that I was born in the dressing room, cradled in the top of a flat theatrical trunk with my ears full of Shakespeare's lines before I ever said ""Mama,"" let alone lamped a TV; hush-walked when I cried by whoever was off stage, old props my first toys, trying to eat crepe hair my first indiscretion, sticks of grease-paint my first crayons. You know, I really wouldn't be bothered by crazy fears about New York changing and the dressing room shifting around in space and time, if I could be sure I'd always be able to stay in it and that the same sweet guys and gals would always be with me and that the shows would always go on. [SNIPPET] It was a completely unmanly thing to do, but he couldn't help himself. The tears flowed down over his cheeks, washing away all his shattered illusions. He would never dream such dreams again. From now on, it would be useless. They would be watching him carefully to make sure that he didn't leave the planet. He heard the captain say in astonishment, ""I didn't know these young ones could cry like that."""
2139,"Instead, he took an old envelope and a stub of pencil from his pocket and wrote the English word for each thing they pointed out. "" ORANGE,"" he wrote—it was not an orange, but the color was the same, at any rate—""THORAX. WALL. MAN. MANDIBLES."" In the afternoon, they brought a machine with staring lenses and bright lights. Weaver guessed that he was being televised; he put a hand on the nearest bug thing's shoulder, and smiled for his audience. [SNIPPET] The Vininese Confederacy—half the galaxy—was peopled by billions upon billions of robot races, ruled by a handful of men with absolute power. To that Dirrul would have betrayed his planet! To slavery and to the destruction of the Rational Potential, all for the slippery dream of orderliness and efficiency which masqueraded as progress. He could save Agron today—but for how long? Sorgel would bewitch countless other discontented Agronian fools. The Movement would try again and one day the Vininese space fleet would penetrate the Agronian Nuclear Beams."
2140,"He even went so far as to say that he was uninterested in rats, that it had just been a passing hobby and that just at present he was working on other matters. So, he asked them to pass out of his life. But he and Carol Crawford went into the wilds of Pike County and did some experimenting on his own account. Meantime, things were going from bad to worse in New York City. The rat racketeers were becoming bolder, and started to reach after larger game. [SNIPPET] ""How about starting a business over in England?"" asked Perkins. ""Not a bad idea. I came over here and together we made half a million selling English groceries to Americans. Perhaps we can make a million more selling American groceries to Englishmen."" Winifred Willowby not only bought the grocery business of Mover & Perkins; he bought a laundry, a small hotel, an apartment house and a theatre."
2141,"Here luck played somewhat of a part, for Hillyard happened to have a contact that proved invaluable to us. Several years before Hillyard had gotten to know a young astrophysicist, Henry Middletown, who had come to him suffering from a severe case of myositis in the arms and shoulders. Hillyard had been able to effect a complete cure for which the boy was very grateful, and they had kept up a desultory correspondence. Middletown was now specializing in radio astronomy at the government's new solar observatory on Turtle Back Mountain in Arizona. If it had not been for Middletown's help I'm afraid our investigation would never have gotten past the clinical stage. [SNIPPET] Jim and I will have to get ourselves fired, then."" ""Fired!"" Belle snorted. "" Clee, you talk like a man with a paper nose! Who else could run the Project? That is,"" her whole manner changed; ""he doesn't know I can run it as well as you can—or better—but I could tell him—and maybe you think I wouldn't!"" ""You won't have to."
2142,"Hanstark began to walk in the direction of Nest's ""cliff."" Nest jumped to his feet and grabbed the official psychiatrist by the arm. ""What're you tryin' to do,"" Nest said angrily, ""kill yourself?"" Hanstark shook free of his grasp. "" Mr. Nest, I am not going to kill myself. [SNIPPET] Maybe I shouldn't let you in after all."" They looked at one another, half amused half frightened. Presently Bob said, ""If you want, I'll—"" ""No, for God's sake."" She caught hold of his sleeve. """
2143,"It was as if some of the earth's gravity had been lost. For a while I examined the valley, but I saw no sign of life there. Then I turned and went slowly up the hill, the sunlight falling warmly on my body, and my feet sinking sensuously in the deep grass. When I came to the crest and looked over, I saw another valley before me, deeper than the first. [SNIPPET] There's a robe and slippers, if you want me to help you get up...."" ""I'm not helpless,"" Chet said, boasting in his turn. He proved it by climbing—gingerly—out of the cot. The boy helped him into the robe, found the slippers, pushed the small room's one chair an inch closer to the open porthole, and left, closing the door behind him. Vaguely Chet found he knew the two men who soon entered the room—they'd been there before. But this was his first fully conscious look at them."
2144,"""Exploring parties ashore,"" Captain Higgins ordered. ""With your permission,"" Craig said, ""I should like to be a member of one of those parties."" ""Certainly,"" the captain said. "" I'll do even better than that—I'll put you in charge of one of them."" ""Thank you, sir,"" Craig said. In accordance with the best naval tradition, he kept his voice emotionless, but his heart leaped at the thought. [SNIPPET] A secret that will smash Interplanetary, that will free the Solar System from Spencer Chambers. But I can't make that secret available to the people until Chambers is crushed, until I'm sure that he can't take it from me. And to do that I need your help."" Mallory's face lost its expression of bewilderment, suddenly lighted with realization. But his voice was harsh and bitter. ""You came too late. I can't help you."
2145,"Sighted a full-rigged ship on the starboard bow. Overhauled her in the first dog-watch. Signalled her; but received no response. During the second dog-watch she steadily refused to communicate. [SNIPPET] And my spirit felt them strike upon the spirit of Naani, and awake her memory, as with the violence of a blow. And for a little while she stumbled, dumb before so much newness and certainly. And her spirit then to waken, and she near wept with the fright and the sudden, new wonder of this thing. And immediately, all about me there came her voice thrilling, and the voice was the voice of Mirdath, and the voice of Naani; and I heard the tears of her spirit make pure and wonderful the bewildered and growing gladness of her far voice. And she asked me, as one who had suddenly opened the Gates of Memory, whether she might be truly Mirdath. And I, utter weak and shaken strangely because of this splendour of fulfilment, could make no instant answer."
2146,"The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She pointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child. ""Food!"" [SNIPPET] He could see Mom through the window, back in her book, so he went casually out through the back gate and turned left, kicking at pebbles as he sauntered along and trying to look as though he had no place to go. Had to be careful. Didn't want to bump into any of the other kids today, either. The way in through the sewer was at a place behind Laboratory B. There was a kind of an alley there that nobody ever walked through and then this round lid you could lift up and look under."
2147,"Sometimes things just don't break."" ""Got to pass,"" said a voice. Johnny, the pilot, was stirring. ""Ha!"" Anderson's voice was exultant. "" [SNIPPET] June looked in stunned silence at the stranger leaning against the tree. Thirty-six light years—thirty-six times six trillion miles of monotonous space travel—to be told that the planet was already settled! "" We didn't know there was a colony here,"" she said. "" It is not on the map."""
2148,"I said that the lines drawn down through the days of greatest mental disturbance slanted slightly. On this second chart the squares were dated under one another not at intervals of twenty-seven days, but at intervals of twenty-seven point three days. LATHAM. Why is that so important? NIEMAND. Because the average period of solar rotation in the sunspot zone is not twenty-seven days but twenty-seven point three days. [SNIPPET] How long does an S-Region last? NIEMAND. An S-Region may have a lifetime of from three to perhaps a dozen solar rotations. Then it dies out and for a time we are free from this malignant radiation. Then a new region develops in perhaps an entirely different region of the Sun."
2149,"The youth developed a tranquil philosophy for these moments of irritation. “ Oh, well,” he rejoined, “he probably didn’t see nothing of it at all and god mad as blazes, and concluded we were a lot of sheep, just because we didn’t do what he wanted done. It’s a pity old Grandpa Henderson got killed yestirday—he’d have known that we did our best and fought good. It’s just our awful luck, that’s what.”  “I should say so,” replied the friend. He seemed to be deeply wounded at an injustice. “ I should say we did have awful luck! [SNIPPET] They all want you. Everybody, from Alsakan to Vandemar and back. We told them right off that we would not receive personal delegations—we had to almost throw a couple of pink-haired Chickladorians out bodily to make them believe that we meant it—and that the age and condition of the vortex involved, not priority of requisition, would govern, QX?"" ""Absolutely,"" Cloud agreed. "" That's the only way it could be, I should think."" ""So forget about this psychic trauma.... No, I don't mean that,"" the Lensman corrected himself hastily. "" You know what I mean."
2150,"I will turn over the country to you. Together we will run the nation, and all I want is just one thing—just one little favor from you."" ""I bet I can guess what that is,"" laughed the Old Man. ""No doubt, but let me tell you. I want to be the next President."" ""I thought so."" [SNIPPET] The Old Man and Willowby held a short whispered conference, and then the leader of American Racketeers stood up. What had been silence before, now became the hush of death. The Old Man was going to talk, and everyone wanted to hear what he had to say. It did not take him long to start. ""You Big Boys have been running the cities before,"" he growled, ""but from tonight on we are going to run the country. Congress and the Supreme Court are going to dance to our music and like it. Our new friend here has promised to deliver the goods, and he does not want much in return."
2151,"The rocket fuel slowed the asteroid down to a point where it was barely turning, and Rip was glad he had been cautious. The heavier charge would have reversed it a little. He directed the placing of a very small charge and was moving away from it so Koa could set it off when Santos suddenly yelled, ""Sir! The Connie is coming!"" Rip called, ""Fire the charge, Koa,"" then looked up. The Consops cruiser was moving slowly toward them. [SNIPPET] The private hurried to his side. "" Take the torch and make us a cave. Make it big enough for the entire crew and the equipment."" Kemp was a good Planeteer."
2152,"The man looked up and stared for a moment at Hanstark. "" Yep,"" he answered. Then he turned and stared at the grass again. ""And may I ask you what you are doing?"" [SNIPPET] A symptom is a subjective feeling of the patient, like aches, pains, nausea, dizziness, or spots before the eyes. “And MacNeil is beginning to get all kinds of symptoms. Trouble is, he’s got a record of hypochondria, and I can’t tell which of the symptoms are psychosomatic and which, if any, might be caused by the fruit.” “The trouble is,” said Petrelli, “that we have an unidentifiable disease caused by an unidentifiable agent which is checked by an unidentifiable something in MacNeil. And we have neither the time nor the equipment to find out."
2153,"Weaver hurried up, struck by a sharp suspicion. Indeed, it was Harriet who was being carried out—and a good thing, he thought, that they didn't have to support her full weight. He wondered vaguely if she would die before they got her to a doctor. He could not give the thought his full attention, or feel as much fraternal anxiety as he ought, because— He had ... he had to sneeze. [SNIPPET] Now he found the way back to Corey's blocked by a mob. Then he saw that the object of it all was the First Marsport Bank. It was only toward that that the shaking fists were raised. Gordon managed to get onto a pile of rubble where he could see over the crowd. The doors of the bank were locked shut, but men were attacking it with an improvised battering ram. As he watched, a pompous little man came to the upper window over the door and began motioning for attention."
2154,"Your parents were the finest the human race could produce—intelligent, strong, healthy, high survival quotient. Is this what you mean by deep?"" ""Partly, but also—feeling. I think I feel things better."" The other children waddled in, took their seats and switched on robomonitors in the ritual of classroom procedure. [SNIPPET] You never really appreciate colors until you smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. "" I can't see irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke."" Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip between the two of us."
2155,"If it is spaceworthy or if it can be repaired, we may live. Otherwise, we won't."" ""Just a few minutes. Let me catch my breath."" The Explorer was glad enough for those few minutes. [SNIPPET] I tell you. My Dad said to get rid of them. Let's sort of bury them somewhere or throw them in the creek."" ""He told you to do that."" ""He made me say I had animals and then he said, 'Get rid of them.'"
2156,"Jim came and stood beside him, heavy shoulder muscles bunched into knots, standing on the balls of his feet as a boxer stands before flashing in at an opponent. ""Shall we have it out with them here and now?"" said Jim, his jaws set. "" We wouldn't have a chance—but I'm beginning to get awfully doubtful about the fate these things have in store for us. [SNIPPET] And then tension seemed to ebb from him, as if the worst had happened. "" So now you know who I am!"" Mattern picked his words delicately. "" If you have proof that I murdered your father, why don't you prosecute? There's no statute of limitation on murder on any of the planets."
2157,"The top of her head came just above Orne's dress epaulets. ""We want you to feel at home here, Lewis,"" she husked. "" You're to consider yourself one of the family."" Orne looked around at the Bullone guest room: low key furnishings with an old-fashioned selectacol for change of decor. A polawindow looked out onto an oval swimming pool, the glass muted to dark blue. It gave the outside a moonlight appearance. p. 100 There was a contour bed against one wall, several built-ins, and a door partly open to reveal bathroom tiles. [SNIPPET] I’m dreadfully sorry,” he sputtered. “ Please accept my sincerest——” The flare-up of rage ended; she was sobbing bitterly, leaning against the wall, wailing that nobody had ever treated her like that before, that she’d be set back three years if he told anybody, that she was a good, self-controlled girl and he had no right to treat her that way, and what kind of degenerate was he, not yet twenty and going around kissing girls when everybody knew you went crazy from it. He soothed her—from a distance. Her sobbing dropped to a bilious croon as she climbed the ladder to the yellow vat, tears still on her face, and checked its temperature. Ross, wondering if he were already crazy from too much kissing of girls, mechanically resumed his duties. But she had responded."
2158,"I re-examined the guinea-pig, and observed it carefully. I need not detail my studies. But in the end I found that my 'mistake' had in reality been a momentous discovery. I found that I had only to close certain organs, to re-arrange certain ducts, and to open certain dormant organs, and, mirabile dictu, the whole process of reproduction was changed. [SNIPPET] It was my love for Alice—I had forgotten that! I cannot write here all the infinity of emotions I experienced later, when, with Alice in my arms, it suddenly came upon me what I had done. Ages ago—I have forgotten how to feel. I could name now a thousand feelings I used to have, but I can no longer even understand them. For only the heart can understand the heart, and the intellect only the intellect."
2159,"Besides, there were certain puzzling facets that would scarcely look plausible in the dehydrated prose of an official report to Security. It smacked almost of the supernatural. Eyeing his small guest, who was happily and rather messily devouring a piece of French pastry, accompanied by a bottle of ginger-ale—sent up by room service—the General suppressed a chill that rose from his coccyx to his cervical vertebrae. Like most veteran men of action, the General did not decry the supernatural—such decrying was the property of armchair logicians. In the course of his long career he had seen too many things that defied logic or logical explanation. He said, ""Ready to take off, Toby?"" [SNIPPET] The cornice-dandruff pattered down. A few small fragments rebounded from the metal hoopskirt. Robie made some small, uncertain movements, as if feeling for broken bones. He was hunting for the traffic light, but it no longer shone either red or green."
2160,"Was the whole thing then a delusion of an overwrought mind? I stood staring at the instrument in amazement. The Martian, now seeing by my actions that his voice had been heard, raised his instrument and repeated his greeting. The voice rang as clearly as before; there could be no further doubt; through this wonderful instrument the Martian's voice was projected, almost instantaneously to the Earth—millions of miles in a second. The mysterious power which enabled the Martian to project the waves, compared with our electricity as the telegraph does with the stage-coach. [SNIPPET] The keeper led Turan to a part of the courtyard where the majority of the slaves were assembled.  ""Take your choice of those not assigned,"" said the keeper, ""and when you have your quota conduct them to the field. Your place will be assigned you by an officer there, and there you will remain with your pieces until the second game is called. I wish you luck, U-Kal, though from what I have heard you will be more lucky to lose than to win the slave from Helium.""  After the fellow had departed Turan approached the slaves. "" I seek the best swordsmen for the second game,"" he announced. "" Men from Gathol I wish, for I have heard that these be noble fighters."""
2161,"It was enough. Terror and astonishment seized them. A few of them cried out against me, but their voices were soon hushed amid the murmurs of fear. One of them, in the name of the rest, then came and besought of me to grant them liberty to amuse themselves; but I refused peremptorily, dared the whole multitude so much as to touch me with one of their fingers, and dismissed them in the name of the Lord.  Again they all fled and dispersed at my eye, and I went home in triumph, escorted by my friend, and some well-meaning young Christians, who, however, had not learned to deport themselves with soberness and humility. But my ascendancy over my enemies was great indeed; for wherever I appeared I was hailed with approbation, and, wherever my guilty brother made his appearance, he was hooted and held in derision, till he was forced to hide his disgraceful head, and appear no more in public. [SNIPPET] Now, how is it that you say this, knowing, as you do, that I never hired you, and never paid you a sixpence of wages in the whole course of my life, excepting this last month?""  ""Ye may as weel say, master, that water's no water, or that, stanes are no stanes. But that's just your gate, an' it's a great pity, aye to do a thing an profess the clean contrair. Weel then, since you havena paid me ony wages, an' I can prove day and date when I was hired, an' came hame to your service, will you be sae kind as to pay me now? That's the best way o' curing a man o' the mortal disease o' leasing-making that I ken o'.""  ""I should think that Penpunt and Cameronian principles would not admit of a man taking twice payment for the same article."""
2162,"Think of it! No soldier could be killed or held prisoner. And—” “Now hang on,” objected Max. “ Let’s not run away with ourselves. [SNIPPET] He passed his hand through the desk again. “ Well, well. Are you sure Busch told you everything?” “Busch! He honestly wants to help and we have taken him through the mill."
2163,"There was no tourist trade, for the planet was too far from the rest of the Galaxy. The commercial spaceships came only once every three months and left the same day. The two destroyers that ""guarded"" the planet arrived at rare intervals for fueling or repairs, but the crew never had anything to do with the Uxenach. Local ordinance forbade the maidens of Uxen to speak to the outlanders, and the outlanders were not interested in any of the other native products. [SNIPPET] The back of this one came to an abrupt stop halfway up his spine, and his shoulders ached even though he had been sitting for only a few moments. He had taken off his gloves and tucked them in his sword belt, and he sat with his fists clenched in his lap. De Verceuil strode across the room and stood over Simon. "" I may yet demand that you be sent home."
2164,"""Get anything?"" he yelled. ""Yes, gas of some sort. Taking the reading now. It seems to be mostly nitrogen."" [SNIPPET] Then Jon punched the button to open the outer lockdoor. It was possible to do this while the inner one was still open, since there was now air outside to equalize the pressure. When the door had swung open a couple of feet, Jon stopped the motor, and joined his brother, who was peering through the opening. The huge creature was still facing them, about forty yards from the ship."
2165,"He broke into a run, the team following his lead. Hal cried “Whoa! whoa!” but they gave no heed. He tripped and was pulled off his feet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs dashed on up the street, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare. [SNIPPET] Perrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its despatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand—“One in ten t’ousand,” he commented mentally.  Buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal, it was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called François."
2166,"Perhaps I, myself...."" ""Beware,"" the mother said sternly, ""that you do not fall into your own traps."" ""But you have never really known a man, have you? I mean, except for servants?"" ""I have also,"" she said, ""never had an intimate conversation with a lion, nor shared my noonday thoughts with a spider."" ""But lions and spiders can't talk. That's the difference. [SNIPPET] The Morals Squad raised their weapons. The Director shook her head imperiously and they snapped to attention again. "" If you take him from us,"" she called out to Jenny, ""you'll be outlawed. We'll hunt you down, if we can."""
2167,"""Good. You can call me Jennie."" ""Thanks."" ""Then you are enjoying your vacation."" [SNIPPET] There was an ant-city, whose foot-long warriors competed with the humans as scavengers. There were the bees, trying to eke out a livelihood from the great, cruciform flowers of the giant cabbage-plants and the milkweeds when water-lilies in the swamps did not bear their four-foot blooms. Wasps sought their own prey. Flies were consumers of corruption, but even the flies two feet in length would shy away from a man who waved his arms at it."
2168,"Kliu stared at him for a second. "" Kinetic energy! Built up gradually!"" He jumped to his feet. "" Come on! [SNIPPET] They thought they were getting somewhere. They promised themselves an eternity of effort. And all the while there was wriggling toward them out of that future for which they yearned ... oh, it's so completely futile and unfair."" ""I disagree,"" the Archeologist said spiritedly. "" Really, your absence from Earth has unsettled you even more than I first surmised."
2169,"I warn you—the more I'm plied, the less pliant I get."" And an hour after that she stated, ""We might get some place if we'd stay some place. I mean the subject seems to be getting elusive."" ""The hell,"" Norbert Holt announced recklessly, ""with editorial relations. [SNIPPET] In him, somewhere, was gnawing anger. This island, this place, was real. Back in his past a horrible wrong had been done, a wrong that now could never be corrected. He put the thought out of his mind. The ledge turned into the cliff and became a tunnel that had been carved into solid stone. The walls of the tunnel were as smooth as polished marble. What tools could men have used in the old days to cut a tunnel with walls so smooth that they looked like glass?"
2170,"""I see. Who is your leader?"" ""I can't tell you. You know that. I wouldn't ask you your leader's name."" Lynn shrugged slim shoulders. "" It wouldn't make any difference. [SNIPPET] I got no reason to—unless you make me. We're going back there. We're double-tracking along the beach, get me? Back to the prison dome."" ""But—"" ""Adam Slade won't starve to death out here. We'll double back to the dome—and the time machine."""
2171,"His face goes grayish and he stares at me helplessly. Finally he nods. ""All right, Lizzie. I guess we have to try it. Things certainly can't be much worse than they are. [SNIPPET] Oh ... I was referring to her intelligence, sir. It's amazing that a woman should have such a thorough knowledge of such a complex process."" Kane felt the birth pains of the first dark premonition. ""If you don't want a thorough knowledge of the interior of State prison,"" he said in grim warning, ""you'd better get that silly look off your face and concentrate on your duties. Tell Dalon the same order applies to him. And tell Larue that the commander reminds him they now have less than forty hours to finish the job."""
2172,"But when this consuming fire has left me—this feeling which until now burns and palpitates in every drop of my blood, every fiber of my being—I know that you shall still be to me a sweet, sacred sister and immaculate bride, worshipped more of my soul than any mother in the house; that loving and being loved by you shall be my one great joy all my life long.""  I drained the cup deliberately, then stopped the bottle and put it back in its place. The liquor was tasteless, but colder than ice, and made me shiver when I swallowed it. I began to wonder whether I would be conscious of the change it was destined to work in me or not; and then, half regretting what I had done, I wished that Yoletta would come to me, so that I might clasp her in my arms with all the old fervor once more, before that icy-cold liquor had done its work. Finally, I carefully raised the fallen book, and smoothed out its doubled leaves, regretting that I had injured it; and, sitting down again, I held the open volume as before, resting on my knees. Now, however, I perceived that it had opened at a place some pages in advance of the passages which had excited me; but, feeling no desire to go back to resume my reading just where I had left off, my eyes mechanically sought the top of the page before me, and this is what I read: [SNIPPET] The said dame had a son, Thibault by name, who was heir of the country of St. Pol, but a poor man so long as his uncle lived; he was a brave knight and a valiant, and good at arms: noble he was, and goodly, and was much honoured and loved of good folk; for a high man he was, and gentle of blood. Now the Count of Ponthieu, with whom beginneth this tale, had a wife, a much good dame: of the said dame he had a daughter, much good and of much avail, the which waxed in great beauty and multiplied in much good; and she was of well sixteen years of age. But within the third year of her birth, her mother died, whereof sore troubled she was and much sorrowful. The Count, her father, wedded him right speedily thereafter, and took a high lady and a gentle; and in a little while the Count had of the said lady a son, whom he loved much."
2173,"Now do ye miss Sir Lancelot, for he would not have failed you in right nor yet in wrong, as ye have often proved, but now ye have driven him from the country.”  “Alas! fair knight,” said the queen, “I put me wholly at your mercy, and all that is done amiss I will amend as ye will counsel me.”  And therewith she kneeled down upon both her knees before Sir Bors, and besought him to have mercy on her.  Anon came in King Arthur also, and prayed him of his courtesy to help her, saying, “I require you for the love of Lancelot.”  “My lord,” said he, “ye require the greatest thing of me that any man can ask, for if I do this battle for the queen I shall anger all my fellows of the Table Round; nevertheless, for my lord Sir Lancelot’s sake, and for yours, I will that day be the queen’s champion, unless there chance to come a better knight than I am to do battle for her.” And this he promised on his faith. [SNIPPET] With that the porter went to the duchess who owned the castle. “ Let him in straightway,” cried she; “for the king’s sake he shall not be harbourless!” and went down to receive him. When Sir Gareth saw her coming, he saluted her, and said, “Fair lady, I pray you give me shelter for this night, and if there be here any champion or giant with whom I must needs fight, spare me till to-morrow, when I and my horse shall have rested, for we are full weary.” “ Sir knight,” she said, “thou speakest boldly; for the lord of this castle is a foe to King Arthur and his court, and if thou wilt rest here to-night thou must agree, that wheresoever thou mayest meet my lord, thou must yield to him as a prisoner.” “"
2174,"Alas! the last agony had seized her. The rainbow-hued forests had all melted away, and Animula lay struggling feebly in what seemed to be a spot of dim light. Ah! [SNIPPET] Curiously enough, he had made several speeches to his friends the preceding week, that seemed to point to self-destruction. One gentleman swore that Simon had said in his presence that ""he was tired of life."" His landlord affirmed that Simon, when paying him his last month's rent, remarked that ""he should not pay him rent much longer."" All the other evidence corresponded—the door locked inside, the position of the corpse, the burnt papers."
2175,"I've felt it for years—something that's part of the cold and hates all warmth and wants to destroy the Nest. It's been watching us all this time, and now it's coming after us. It'll get you and then come for me. Don't go, Harry!"" Pa had everything on but his helmet. [SNIPPET] Below, neck-craning citizens crowded streets and back yards, cranks and cultists had a field day, while local and national governments raged indiscriminately at Puffyloaf and at each other. Rumors that a fusion weapon would be exploded in the midst of the flying bread drew angry protests from conservationists and a flood of telefax pamphlets titled ""H-Loaf or H-bomb?"" Stockholm sent a mystifying note of praise to the United Nations Food Organization. Delhi issued nervous denials of a millet blight that no one had heard of until that moment and reaffirmed India's ability to feed her population with no outside help except the usual."
2176,"It's almost ..."" he was silent, and Hanlon's probes found only puzzlement. ""Nuts!"" the young Corpsman felt frustrated. "" If only I could really read minds! I think this guy knows something I want to learn, but I can't get the least idea of what it is."" But he kept trying, and not only with the mind of this one man he had been sent here to guard. [SNIPPET] ""Hold on, Babs, a little longer,"" he urged. They fell into torpid sleep after they had devised a mechanism to arouse them with an electric shock at an appointed time. It conserved their strength and allowed them to pass the long interval quickly. Ed Dukas's slumber was not altogether dreamless."
2177,"""In a week there was hunger. In two weeks there were famine and plague, in three weeks war and anarchy. We called off the experiment; it took us most of the next generation to get things squared away again."" ""But why didn't you let them kill each other off?"" ""Five billion corpses mean about five hundred million tons of rotting flesh."" Barlow had another idea. "" [SNIPPET] ""It is as real as life, but it moves swiftly as a dream. You seem to pass through certain things slowly and completely, in the tempo of life. Then, when the transitional moment comes, between the scenes, your sensations pass with unbelievable rapidity. The Chamber has possession of your mind. It tells you that you are doing such and such a thing, it gives you all the feeling of doing that thing, and you actually believe you are doing it. And when it snatches you away from one day and takes you into the next, it has only to make you feel that a day has passed, and it is as though you had lived through that day."
2178,"“I sure am!” Jim agreed, still gazing ruefully at the ruined negatives. “ Funny, though. The camera was checked before I started. I had the range before I pulled the trigger, every shot.” He paused, then added, as though reluctant to excuse himself: “It must have been the heat.” [SNIPPET] Then, edging over to Jim and slipping her arm in his, she murmured: “Oh, my dear! Don’t you see I couldn’t stay behind? I had to be with you at the end, Jimmy, if—” “It won’t be!”"
2179,"The mecs probably wouldn't have been able to give them depth but, he remembered, the other role of the mecs was to prevent each one of them from harming the others. In their role as arbitrator, Adam realized, they might have stopped him from hurting them so. Filled with remorse, he left his desk-chair and walked stoop-shouldered under the low ceiling. At the trapdoor, he opened the combination on the inside lock handle and pushed upward. It wouldn't open. He tried again, but it wasn't the lock that was stuck. [SNIPPET] ""In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting Executive Officer."" ""Huh?"" Quade gawked. "" But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!"
2180,"You couldn't get to the crime in time. That's why they built the watchbirds."" ""I don't think they'll stop no criminals,"" one of the policemen insisted. ""They sure will. I read the test results. [SNIPPET] All that talk was just to hold my attention while he fixed the needles and— I left the kit spread out right next to him. While I am taking this in some small cold corner of my mind is remembering the instructions that are on the pain-killer ampoule; it does not say, outright, that it is the last refuge for men in the extremity of pain and despair; therefore it cannot say, outright, that they sometimes despair too soon; but it does tell you the name of the antidote. There are only three ampoules of this and they also say, maximum dose one ampoule. I try to work it out but lacking all other information the best I can do is inject two and keep one till later. I put that one in my pocket. The stretcher is all expanded now; a very thin but quite rigid grid, six feet by two; I lash him on it without changing his position and fasten the helmet over his head."
2181,"Frank Tracy said, ""You're all under arrest. Jerry, herd these clerks, or whatever they are, into some other room. Get any other occupants of the house together, too. And watch them carefully, confound it. Don't underestimate these people. [SNIPPET] The thread will break if you try to lift the model with it. Yet you can lift the model—after a small increment of its weight has been removed by the coils. This is going to bug these men. Nobody is going to ask them to solve the problem or concern themselves with it. But it will nag at them because they know this effect can't possibly exist. They'll see at once that the magnetic-wave theory is nonsense. Or perhaps true?"
2182,"It was strange not to hear the hissing of the steam, so near I seemed. There were the college buildings on the hill, the long rows of windows flashing back the level sunbeams. I could tell the time by the college clock. It struck me that there was an unusual bustle around the buildings, considering the earliness of the hour. [SNIPPET] Mrs. Rhinehart's letter had been received in the morning, and during the rest of the day Miss Ludington and Paul seemed quite to forget each other in their absorption in the thoughts suggested by the approaching event. They sat abstracted and silent at table, and, on rising, went each their own way. In the exalted state of their imaginations the enterprise they had in hand would not bear talking over. When she retired to bed Miss Ludington found that sleep was out of the question."
2183,"I told him I'd help him. I was waiting for the chance to get to you. He was by the interphone a few minutes ago. It was the chance I needed. [SNIPPET] His flesh-bedded eyes studied her. ""He came to me for help. I had to bide my time. I told him I'd help him. I was waiting for the chance to get to you. He was by the interphone a few minutes ago. It was the chance I needed."
2184,"What does God mean by shutting us up here? Look at the cattle; 0 Christ, they have found it out too! See, some of them are turning to run back again towards Harald's land. Oh! unhappy, unhappy, from that day forward!"" [SNIPPET] It is very hard to describe the interior of a great church like this, especially since the whitewash (applied, as I said, on this scale in 1771) lies on everything so; before that time, some book says, the church was painted from end to end with patterns of flowers and stars, and histories: think—I might have been able to say something about it then, with that solemn glow of colour all about me, as I walked there from sunrise to sunset; and yet, perhaps, it would have filled my heart too full for speaking, all that beauty; I know not. Up into the triforium, and other galleries, sometimes in the church, sometimes in narrow passages of close-fitting stone, sometimes out in the open air; up into the forest of beams between the slates and the real stone roof: one can look down through a hole in the vaulting and see the people walking and praying on the pavement below, looking very small from that height, and strangely foreshortened. A strange sense of oppression came over me at that time, when, as p. 142we were in one of the galleries of the west front, we looked into the church, and found the vaulting but a foot or two (or it seemed so) above our heads; also, while I was in the galleries, now out of the church, now in it, the canons had begun to sing complines, and the sound of their singing floated dimly up the winding stair-cases and half-shut doors. The sun was setting when we were in the roof, and a beam of it, striking through the small window up in the gable, fell in blood-red spots on the beams of the great dim roof."
2185,"Jennings called to the major. ""Can't tell yet. It's coming in too fast. I'm trying to slow it. We'll know in a minute."" ""You have it now,"" Professor Stein spoke up quietly. "" It's slowing. [SNIPPET] His suspicions were confirmed. There wasn't a red Cadillac anywhere in sight, and from the looks of the street there never had been. "" It's gone,"" he said, but the cops weren't listening. ""We better get you to a hospital,"" Bill said. "" As soon as the prowl car gets here we'll take you right on down to St. Vincent's. Can you tell us what happened?"
2186,"If only I could have gone out into the gardens, as is my wont, I should have been content enough; but to be cooped in this silent house, with no companion, save a mad woman and a sick dog, was enough to prey upon the nerves of the hardiest. And out in the tangled shrubberies that surrounded the house, lurked—for all I could tell—those infernal Swine-creatures waiting their chance. Was ever a man in such straits? Once, in the afternoon, and again, later, I went to visit my sister. The second time, I found her tending Pepper; but, at my approach, she slid over, unobtrusively, to the far corner, with a gesture that saddened me beyond belief. Poor girl! her fear cut me intolerably, and I would not intrude on her, unnecessarily. [SNIPPET] He dropped a few of the crystals in a test tube and added distilled water. The water assumed a pink tinge as the blood with which the crystals were covered dissolved, but the crystals themselves did not change. They rose and floated on the surface of the water. ""Insoluble in water, Davis,"" commented the doctor. "" Better wash the lot and then we'll get after the ultimate analysis. Whether we'll be able to make a proximate is doubtful in view of the small amount of sample we have. It's dollars to doughnuts that it's some carbon compound."""
2187,"""I used a system differing in many respects from that of the commercial radio. We haven't time now to go into all that—I can tell you later, and it involves much that is highly technical and still secret. It is sufficient if I explain that my object was to evolve and fuse methods for doing with each of the senses what radio does with sound. Telephotography was the simplest problem—the others required an almost superhuman amount of labor. [SNIPPET] I could name now a thousand feelings I used to have, but I can no longer even understand them. For only the heart can understand the heart, and the intellect only the intellect. With Alice in my arms, I told the whole story. It was she who, with her quick instinct, grasped what I had never noticed. ""But Carl!"""
2188,"It's only a matter of time and practise until I can stand the open. After all, it isn't any worse than being a steel worker or steeplejack. Even if the worst came to the worst, I'd rather be burst open by the frozen vacuum of interstellar space than to splash upon a sidewalk before an admiring populace—and people do that every day!"" Dr. Grosnoff, who was present, expressed great delight. His patient was coming along well mentally, at least. [SNIPPET] Then again, maybe my brain is addled by this thing. In any case, the moral is: don't monkey with Nature! She's particular."" Tristan's vaudeville scheme was not as easily realized as said. The first manager to whom we applied was stubbornly skeptical in spite of Tristan's appearance standing upside down in stilts heavily weighted at the ground ends; and even after his resistance was broken down in a manner which left him gasping and a little woozy, began to reason unfavorably in a hard-headed way. Audiences, he explained, were off levitation acts. Too old."
2189,"At this, the crowd jeered and booed the too-hasty youth, who became so resentfully abusive of Tristan that one of the attendants pushed him out of the tent. As he passed me, I caught fragments of wrathy words: ""Wisht I had a ... Show'm whether it's a fake...."" Tristan closed his act by dropping full-length to the end of his invisible wire, then pulled himself down, got into his stilts, and was unfastening the belt, when the manager rushed in with a request that he repeat, for the benefit of a special party just arrived on a delayed train. [SNIPPET] I believe now that it wasn't Ganymede. Maybe it was some other moon of Jupiter's. ""Anyway, I seem to recall having some trouble with my health, and being taken onto an inter-planetary hospital ship for treatment—L-treatment, they called it. That's where they put me to sleep. What happened after that, I can only guess."
2190,"An unexpected display of adult characteristics might give rise to some questions he would find hard to answer credibly. Fortunately, he was an only child; there would be no brothers or sisters to trip him up. Old Mrs. Stauber, the housekeeper, wouldn't be much of a problem; even in his normal childhood, he had bulked like an intellectual giant in comparison to her. But his father— Now, there the going would be tough. He knew that shrewd attorney's mind, whetted keen on a generation of lying and reluctant witnesses. [SNIPPET] The kinetic energy of such a collision can be computed. It can be expressed. It is, however, of such astronomical magnitude as to be completely meaningless to the human mind. Simply, the two worlds merged and splashed. Droplets, weighing up to millions of tons each, spattered out into space; only to return, in seconds or hours or weeks or months, to add their atrocious contributions to the enormity of the destruction already wrought. No trace survived of any Strett or of any thing, however small, pertaining to the Stretts. AS had become a daily custom, most of the Ardans were gathered at the natatorium."
2191,"But look, suppose he’s a natural telepath ... the same as a Terran. He has an erratic, difficult-to-control talent. Then he gets into a dueling machine. The machine amplifies his thoughts. And it also amplifies his talent!” “Ohhh.” “You see ... outside the machine, he’s no better than any wandering fortuneteller. [SNIPPET] “But—” The prime minister’s face suddenly hardened; his advisors lapsed into a respectful silence. The chief meditech ushered Dulaq back into his booth. On the other side of the room, Odal glanced at the Acquatainians, grinned humorlessly, and strode to his own booth. Dulaq sat and tried to blank out his mind while the meditechs adjusted the neurocontacts to his head and torso. They finished at last and withdrew. He was alone in the booth now, looking at the dead-white walls, completely bare except for the viewscreen before his eyes."
2192,"""Have you got control?"" Jennings called to the major. ""Can't tell yet. It's coming in too fast. I'm trying to slow it. [SNIPPET] No fade, no dying signal, just out!"" It was the first time Jennings had ever heard a note of excitement in Professor Stein's voice. The phone began to ring, loud and shrill. That would be from the General's observation post, where he, too, must have lost the signal. The excitement penetrated the senator's rosy dream of vast acreages being sold at a huge profit, giant walls of factories going up under his remote-control ownership. """
2193,"They had to take a risk with the full knowledge that the odds were against them. But if they didn't take the risk, the blast would push them outward from the asteroid—into full sunlight. The end result would be the same. ""We're not going to make it, Santos,"" he began. ""I know it, sir,"" Santos replied. Rip thought anyone with that much coolness and sheer nerve rated some kind of special treatment. And the young corporal had shown his ability time and time again. [SNIPPET] Of course you are overwhelmed. One could hardly expect to adopt the view of van Manderpootz without some difficulties of adjustment. A second time will be easier."" I reached up and switched off the light. "" A second time will not only be easier, but also impossible,"" I said crossly. """
2194,"Now, I'm a poet. Therefore, and to wit, I'm also a magician. On this hangup, I'm going to try magic. Electronics won't work, that's for sure."" ""But...."" Mr. Rapp was not quite sure why he disapproved, but he did. On the other hand, the repairman appeared to be very definitely sure of what he was doing, as he peered into the back of the television set. ""Have you ever tried ... ah, this method before?"" [SNIPPET] Get your coat. You're wanted at headquarters."" McLeod started to say something, then thought better of it. There was nothing he could say. Nobody would care if the U.B.I. manhandled him."
2195,"Five minutes out of Marsport, Jonner thrust the muzzle of a heat-gun in the pilot's back. ""Set it on automatic, strap on your parachute and bail out,"" he ordered. "" We're taking over."" The pilot had no choice. He went through the plane's airlock and jumped, helped by a hearty boost from Jonner. [SNIPPET] A long corridor opened up before him and what appeared before to be an illusion of distance actually was distance. He guessed he was near the engine compartment and vaguely sensed that the luminescence had something to do with the nuclear engines that Mecteacher told him moved the ship. It was warm in here. Not physically warm but friendy warm, like when Mecmother spoke her comfort. The similarity almost made him cry, for he understood, even in his seven years, that Mecmother was but the image of his real mother who lived long ago and said those words of sympathy to a child yet unborn."
2196,"""Best way to find out is for a man to go out there and see,"" the senator commented shortly. "" I want to find out something, I go look at it myself. I don't depend on charts and graphs, and folderol."" The major did not even hunch his broad shoulders, a characteristic gesture, to show that he had heard, to show that he wished the senator was out there in untested space.[108] ""What about him? He's not even in uniform!"" ""Professor Stein maintains sight contact on the scope and transmits the IFF pulse."" [SNIPPET] ""General, you can't,"" Jennings moaned. He forgot rank, everything. ""I've already done it, Jim,"" the general chose to ignore the outburst. "" He's due there now. I'll look to you to handle it. He's got to be won over, Colonel. It's your project."""
2197,"There were a couple of thick copper electrodes coming out of the side of it, and he claimed that they could be tapped for tremendous amounts of power. 125 Well, we listened, and we watched his demonstrations in the lab. He ran some heavy-duty motors off it and a few other things like that. I don’t remember what all.” “And he wanted to sell it to you sight-unseen?” Thorn asked. “That’s right,” said the colonel. “ [SNIPPET] Krannon's death will turn the city against you. There'll be no more supplies. They'll attack you when they can, kill your people—"" ""Of course we know that!"" Rhes leaned forward, his voice hoarse and intense. "" It wasn't an easy decision to come to."
2198,"But Shelby, skilled as were most of the men of his time, in the handling of small space craft, was able to endow his flier with much of the agility of an alarmed dragon fly. Darting, weaving, zigzagging, yet always keeping its general course fixed toward Mars, it careened away. Always it was ringed by an aura of green flashes. However, good fortune is seldom perfect. The tempered duralumin plates of the flier managed to withstand the force of all of the torpedo fragments which showered them—with one exception. One dart from Hekalu's ship exploded barely fifty feet to the right of the fugitive craft, and a flying chunk of steel sent it pitching and tumbling through the ether. [SNIPPET] Anyway, I found animals this morning. Two of them."" ""And you've got them?"" ""Sure. That's the secret."
2199,"Eyer's nose was bleeding and one eye was closed when the reception committee finally came to close quarters, smothered them by sheer weight of numbers, and made them prisoners. Jeter's right wrist was manacled to Eyer's left with a pair of ordinary steel handcuffs. Their weapons were taken away from them now. The leader of the committee, panting, but apparently unconcerned over what had happened, motioned the two men to lead the way. He pointed to the large building in the center of the ""floor."" ""That way,"" he said, ""and I hope Sitsumi and The Three give us permission to throw you out without parachutes or high altitude suits."" [SNIPPET] In the main room it was possible, through the use of telescopes and audiphones—set into the walls so that they were invisible, yet enabled any one in the room to see everything, and hear everything that transpired on the far earth below—to keep close watch on the work of the destroyers. Anything close enough could be seen with the naked eye through the walls of the globe. Now the space ship was systematically destroying buildings the length and breadth of Manhattan Island. The river-front buildings were destroyed in a single sweep, from north to south, of the ghastly ray. Farther back from the Hudson, however, after the water-front buildings had been reduced to mere piles of rubble, the most beautiful, most modern buildings were left standing. ""Can't you just imagine those beautiful structures filled with the monsters created by the genius of Sitsumi and the Three—and their as yet unknown lieutenants back at Lake Baikal?"""
2200,"Sitting beside him, the Duke looked curiously at the venerable profile, as at a mummy’s. To think that this had once been a man! To think that his blood flowed in the veins of Zuleika! Hitherto the Duke had seen nothing grotesque in him—had regarded him always as a dignified specimen of priest and scholar. [SNIPPET] The slave did not start the cage downward. Every second counted. They must reach the lower level as soon as possible after Astok and Vas Kor if they would know whither the two went.  Carthoris turned suddenly upon the slave, hurling him to the opposite side of the cage."
2201,"He was embarrassed, he was humiliated, and he showed both very clearly. He had lost all of his air of easy aplomb. "" I'm very sorry, sir. I didn't think—"" ""That's just it, you didn't think. [SNIPPET] But the man looked fearfully at the giant and hung back. Even as they talked, his gigantic body had grown as high as the four-storied buildings lining the Square, and his feet were becoming too large for the place where they had first been put. And now a faint smile could be seen on the giant's face, an enigmatic smile, with something ironic and bitter in it. ""Then shout to him from here,"" pressed the sergeant nervously. "" We've got to find out something!"
2202,"So it shall, if the power remain with me to save it. I am come to redeem my pledge, and to save your life by the sacrifice of my own. Here—not one word of expostulation, change habits with me, and you may then pass by the officers, and guards, and even through the approaching mob, with the most perfect temerity. There is a virtue in this garb, and, instead of offering to detain you, they shall pay you obeisance. Make haste, and leave this place for the present, flying where you best may, and, if I escape from these dangers that surround me, I will endeavour to find you out, and bring you what intelligence I am able.""  I put on his green frock coat, buff belt, and a sort of a turban that he always wore on his head, somewhat resembling a bishop's mitre: he drew his hand thrice across my face, and I withdrew as he continued to urge me. [SNIPPET] I never knew the air to be more bland and more calm. In this interval I glanced at the temple, and thought I saw a glimmering between the columns. It was so faint, that it would not perhaps have been visible, if the moon had not been shrowded. I looked again, but saw nothing."
2203,"""Medicine?"" ""Nope."" ""I give up."" ""It's animal serum,"" Bob said, sliced his thumb on the sardine can, glanced unemotionally at the cut, ignored it. [SNIPPET] ""It's certain properties without which the universe in eternity regards for human beings."" ""Oh,"" Bonnie said. She took off her apron and sat down at the other end of the kitchen. The smell from the juicer was beginning to reach her stomach. Bobby combed the kitchen for something else to throw into his concoction and came up with some oregano and liquid garlic. ""I guess this is about it,"" he said. He poured the garlic and oregano into his juicer, put the lid on, shook it furiously for a minute and then emptied the contents into a deep pot."
2204,"A mighty shout went rattling about the timbers of the roof in answer to his word; and they that looked up to the gable of the Hall said that they saw the ray-ringed image of the God smile with joy over the gathered folk. But spake Iron-face unheard amidst the clamour of the Hall: ‘How fares it now with my darling and my daughter, who dwelleth amongst strangers in the land beyond the wild-wood?’ Three years and two months thereafter, three hours after noon in the days of early autumn, came a wain tilted over with precious webs of cloth, and drawn by eight white oxen, into the Market-place of Silver-stead: two score and ten of spearmen of the tallest, clad in goodly war-gear, went beside it, and much people of Silver-dale thronged about them. The wain stayed at the foot of the stair that led up to the door of the Mote-house, and there lighted down therefrom a woman goodly of fashion, with wide grey eyes, and face and hands brown with the sun’s burning. She had a helm on her head and a sword girt to her side, and in her arms she bore a yearling child. p. 419And there was come Bow-may with the second man-child born to Face-of-god. [SNIPPET] And haven’t you specially called me to notice that the people about the roads and streets look happy? and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours were shut up in prison, while they bore such things quietly? And if there were people in prison, you couldn’t hide it from folk, like you may an occasional man-slaying; because that isn’t done of set purpose, with a lot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison business is. Prisons, indeed! O no, no, no!” He stopped, and began to cool down, and said in a kind voice: “But forgive me! I needn’t be so hot about it, since there are not any prisons: I’m afraid you will think the worse of me for losing my temper."
2205,"""I do not want to waste your time, Mr. Consuelo,"" began Willowby. "" We ought to be able to understand each other. You would do nicely if the Federal Government would leave you alone, but it has the peculiar ability of annoying you and interfering with your plans. Am I right?"" [SNIPPET] So! Hullo!”  “Back, Sire! Back!”  “Back—right. One—two—three—good God! Ah!"
2206,"""Let's take no chances,"" Rip stated. "" Come on."" The men were already in the boat. He and Koa joined them. They stood at a window, watching the Connie's trail. The trail dwindled. [SNIPPET] Did you ever cut cheese with a wire? In effect, that wire is a knife—a knife that consists only of an edge. ""Or, another experiment you may have heard of. Take a block of ice."
2207,"I'll pick the one I think best qualified!"" ""Yeah, Doc, we know. But what is this super-female gag anyway?"" ""Some women have more female sex genes than others. [SNIPPET] I can! I will! Engineer, I'm going to need plenty of fuel for this course—about ten tons! See that I get it!"" ""Right you are,"" said Watkins. "" Captain, I'd like to put in a requisition for ten tons of fuel."""
2208,"His yellow eyes widened and his hand darted to his girdle and came up with a knife. The nearest tourists fell back in alarm as he hissed malevolently at Albert, ""Stand back, Earthman, or I'll let the life out of your scaleless carcass!"" ""Doublecrosser,"" Albert said, moving in. One meaty hand closed over the knife hand and wrenched while the other caught Shifaz alongside the head with a smack that sounded loud in the sudden quiet. Shifaz did a neat backflip and lay prostrate, the tip of his tail twitching reflexively. One of the tourists screamed. ""No show today, folks,"" Albert said. "" [SNIPPET] Because I didn't deserve what I got."" And there, Mattern thought, Alard had him. Whatever the boy was now, he certainly had not deserved what he'd got then. But I was only sixteen, Mattern argued with himself; how could I have been held responsible? And then he told himself, You haven't been sixteen for twenty-four years. ""I thought one of the women in the village would have adopted you,"" he said."
2209,"In the garden there were three old chestnut-trees, and on a rising ground in the centre might be seen a parasol made of thatch, held up by the trunk of a tree. Under the slatework lining the walls, a big vine-tree, badly fastened, hung from one place to another after the fashion of a rotten cable. The gate-bell, which it was rather hard to pull, was slow in ringing, and a long time always elapsed before it was answered. On each occasion he experienced a pang of suspense, a fear born of irresolution. Then his ears would be greeted with the pattering of the servant-maid's slippers over the gravel, or else Madame Arnoux herself would make her appearance. One day he came up behind her just as she was stooping down in the act of gathering violets.[88] [SNIPPET] For instance, it is just possible, if our fantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during long ages for the same object, might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent rock-pigeon were also destroyed, and in nature we have every reason to believe that the parent-form will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved offspring, it is quite [316]incredible that a fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even from the other well-established races of the domestic pigeon, for the newly-formed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic differences. Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. A group does not reappear after it has once disappeared; or its existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are surprisingly few, so few that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and the rule strictly accords with my theory. For as all the species of the same group have descended from some one species, it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages, so long must its members have continuously existed, in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms. Species of the genus Lingula, for instance, must have continuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day."
2210,"Is there anything that you want to tell me?"" ""No, sir."" Colonel Cooper had the habit of asking that of his workers in the manner of a mother asking a child if he wants to go to the bathroom. There was something embarrassing in his intonation. Well, he did want to tell him something, but he didn't know how to phrase it. [SNIPPET] ""I wonder if they will be better masters? He is an imposing figure, and he would be able to pass for a man. And the colonel is right: The Center is a primary target. ""Why! I never knew you could kill a child just by pointing a finger at him like that!"
2211,"I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit. Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the light of the electric torch I had provided. [SNIPPET] So long,"" he said. "" I've a brother in Tucson, and I'm going to his place until this blows over.""  As he left Oracle, John Redpath noticed several dark globes drifting down on it from the hills.    THE first inkling the outside world had of the terrible tragedy that was happening at Oracle came over the phone to Tucson while John Redpath was still en route to that city.  ""Hello, hello! Is this the police station?"
2212,"The twitter of birds, the buzz of insects, the far-off echo of voices, the lowing of cattle, the distant barking of dogs, roar of trains, and rattle of carts—all these form one low, unremitting note, striking unheeded upon the ear. We missed it now. This deadly silence was appalling. So solemn was it, so impressive, that the buzz and rattle of our motor-car seemed an unwarrantable intrusion, an indecent disregard of this reverent stillness which lay like a pall over and round the ruins of humanity. It was this grim hush, and the tall clouds of smoke which rose here and there over the country-side from smoldering buildings, which cast a chill into our hearts as we gazed round at the glorious panorama of the Weald. [SNIPPET] They were together; and the jostle of earthly happenings might hope, at most, to afford them matter for incurious comment. They sat, as Perion thought, for the last time together, part of an audience before which the Confraternity of St. Médard was enacting a masque of The Birth of Hercules. The Bishop of Montors had returned to Bellegarde that evening with his brother, Count Gui, and the pleasure-loving prelate had brought these mirth-makers in his train. Clad in scarlet, he rode before them playing upon a lute—unclerical conduct which shocked his preciser brother and surprised nobody. In such circumstances Perion began to speak with an odd purpose, because his reason was bedrugged by the beauty and purity of Melicent, and perhaps a little by the slow and clutching music to whose progress the chorus of Theban virgins was dancing. When he had made an end of harsh whispering, Melicent sat for a while in scrupulous appraisement of the rushes. The music was so sweet it seemed to Perion he must go mad unless she spoke within the moment."
2213,"There’s a quarter of a pound of powder in the case, and I have got two newspapers in my pocket for the loadings.’  These were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably feel most grateful. The presumption is, that the gratitude of Mr. Winkle was too powerful for utterance, as he said nothing, but continued to walk on—rather slowly.  ‘We are in excellent time,’ said Mr. Snodgrass, as they climbed the fence of the first field; ‘the sun is just going down.’ Mr. Winkle looked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability of his ‘going down’ himself, before long. [SNIPPET] In another three or four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is, as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been perhaps your own fault?” he added, with a tentative smile, as though still afraid of irritating him.  “It is very possible,” answered Raskolnikov coldly."
2214,"Junior repeated stupidly. ""Fweep?"" Fweep said eagerly. ""He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear polarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. [SNIPPET] The land of the Fweep turned and grew small in the view screen, and Junior sat in the pilot's chair, his hand on the control stick, his eyes fixed on the moving dials in front of him. There were three others in the room: Reba, who looked at the dwindling Fweepland and sighed; Joyce, who sat tautly in her chair, her face fixed and unbelieving; and Fred, who looked at Joyce and shook his head. Grampa opened the door to his room and stepped cockily into the central cabin, shutting the door behind him. "" Well?"""
2215,"I looked all over but I couldn't find him. I was just about ready to phone the police when I glanced out the window into the backyard. And I saw him."" ""What was he doing?"" [SNIPPET] Again he watched objectively as his hand pulled the black object out and handled it. His body was evidently familiar with it, though it was strange to his eyes. His finger slipped automatically into the trigger sheaf. His legs were still working under two drives: the manythoughts' urging, and something else, buried in him. A longing."
2216,"There I could obtain excellent instruments, the newest publications, intimacy with men of pursuits kindred with my own—in short, all things necessary to insure a profitable devotion of my life to my beloved science. I had an abundance of money, few desires that were not bounded by my illuminating mirror on one side and my object-glass on the other; what, therefore, was to prevent my becoming an illustrious investigator of the veiled worlds? It was with the most buoyant hope that I left my New England home and established myself in New York. 2. The Longing of a Man of S My first step, of course, was to find suitable apartments. [SNIPPET] he exclaimed, enraged at finding them always with his patients. They explained their magnetic method of curing. Then he declaimed against magnetism—""a heap of juggleries, whose effects came only from the imagination."" However, animals are magnetised."
2217,"""Not might. Would."" ""So—"" ""So it's an insoluble problem, on our terms. We have to think of this as a war, and of them as our enemies. [SNIPPET] And I? Well, I was very fond of Stella. And the woman they speak of to-day, in that hushed, hateful, sanctimonious voice, I must confess I never knew. And of all persons I chiefly rage against that faultless angel, that ""poor dear Stella,"" who has pilfered even the paltry tribute of being remembered from the Stella that to-day is mine alone."
2218,"""The next part is the thing I don't understand,"" the girl said. ""Well,"" said the man, ""as I get it, they found that any piece of matter that has been part of an organism, retains a physical 'memory' of the entire structure of the organism of which it was part. And that they could reconstruct that structure from a part of a person, if that was all there was left of him. From there it was just a matter of pushing the process back through time. They had to teach me a whole new language to explain that one."" ""Isn't it wonderful that intergalactic travel gives us room to expand?"" said the girl. "" [SNIPPET] The Coroner could think of only the obvious question: ""Why did you kill him?"" ""He was dangerous to us."" ""Whom do you mean by us?"" ""We Martians, who plan to take over your world."" The Coroner was disappointed."
2219,"They began marching and countermarching in very orderly array until another blast of the gold whistle sent them scurrying away as quickly as they had appeared. And as soon as the great cave was again empty Kaliko returned with his visitors to his own royal chamber, where he once more seated himself upon his ivory throne.  ""I have shown you,"" said he to Inga, ""a part of my bodyguard. The royal armies, of which this is only a part, are as numerous as the sands of the ocean, and live in many thousands of my underground caverns. You have come here thinking to force me to give up the captives of King Gos and Queen Cor, and I wanted to convince you that my power is too mighty for anyone to oppose. [SNIPPET] He laughed in the sheik's face and told the mate to call up a few jackies to drive the ""dagoes"" off. "" Rip"" Van Winkle interfered and peace was restored. The cruise had changed ""Rip"" into a happier and far more radiant creature, so it was only natural that he should have shared the secret with Mary Valentine. He had told the story of the sheik's demand to her as soon as he came aboard, and she had divulged it to Peggy the instant ""Rip"" was out of sight.  Brewster found the sheik sitting in state on the upper deck impatiently awaiting the appearance of his charmer."
2220,"“YOU don’t like it!” “Look,” said Orne. “ There must be another way. Why ... when we teamed up with the Alerinoids we gained five hundred years in the physical sciences alone, not to mention the—” “The Alerinoids didn’t knock over one of our survey ships first.” “What if the Delphinus just crashed here ... and the locals picked up the pieces?” “That’s what you’re going in to find out, Orne. [SNIPPET] ""Permit me,"" said Orne. "" The question is: Will I turn in my own sister if it falls that way?"" Stetson remained silent, staring at him. ""O.K.,"" said Orne. "" My job is seeing that we don't have another Rim War."
2221,"Why had they not caused the telegram to be delayed in transmission? They ought to have let him go and riddle Zuleika with his scorn and his indifference. They ought to have let him hurl through her his defiance of them. Art aside, they need not have grudged him that excursion.  He could not, he told himself, face Zuleika now. As artist, he saw that there was irony enough left over to make the meeting a fine one. As theologian, he did not hold her responsible for his destiny. [SNIPPET] He died, and she had about her a large staff of able and faithful servants, whose way of doing their work irritated and depressed her. To them, apparently, life consisted of nothing but politics and military operations—things to which she, being a woman, was somewhat indifferent. She was jealous of Melpomene. It seemed to her that her own servants worked from without at a mass of dry details which might as well be forgotten. Melpomene’s worked on material that was eternally interesting—the souls of men and women; and not from without, either; but rather casting themselves into those souls and showing to us the essence of them. She was particularly struck by a remark of Aristotle’s, that tragedy was “more philosophic” than history, inasmuch as it concerned itself with what might be, while history was concerned with merely what had been."
2222,"His huge paw descended, but before it touched her shoulder a hand with fingers of steel reached through the hangings and grasped his wrist. When Sonom had dragged Lura into the room, Damis inserted the point of his dagger into the tapestry and started to cut a slit through which he could enter the room. The keen-edged knife cut for a few inches readily enough and then stopped. Damis withdrew the blade and examined the stuff before him. [SNIPPET] “Pooh! pooh!” said John Thornton; “Buck can start a thousand pounds.”  “And break it out?"
2223,"The poor man squalled terribly, and the colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him gently on the ground, and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency, which was represented very much to my advantage at court.  Towards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time, the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me. Six hundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my house; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the breadth and length; and these were four double: which, however, kept me but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth stone. [SNIPPET] As they expected it fell out; three of the routed army fled for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of this within, with this comforting addition, that the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way they were gone; upon this the Spanish governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to go round, come in behind them, and surprise and take them prisoners, which was done. The residue of the conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the victors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing themselves into a body together, gave two great screaming shouts, most likely by way of triumph, and so the fight ended; the same day, about three o’clock in the afternoon, they also marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had the island again free to themselves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages for several years after."
2224,"You know what year this is, Bill?"" ""Why, 1984,"" Benson said. ""Yes. You remember that old political novel of Orwell's, written about forty years ago? Well, that's a picture of the kind of world you'd have, eventually, no matter what kind of a world you started out to make. Fred, don't ever think of using this stuff for a purpose like that. If you try it, I'll fight you with every resource I have."" [SNIPPET] Instead, he gave McAllen a cautiously worded reminder that it was not inconceivable they had an audience here, at which McAllen reluctantly subsided. There was, however, one fairly important question Barney still wanted answered today. The nature of the answer would tell him the manner in which McAllen should now be handled. He waited until he was on his feet and ready to leave before presenting it. McAllen's plump cheeks were flushed from the two highballs he had put away; in somewhat awkward phrases he had been expressing his gratitude for Barney's generous help, and his relief that because of it the work on the Tube now could be brought to an end. ""Just one thing about that still bothers me a little, doctor,"" Barney said candidly. McAllen looked concerned. """
2225,"The stillness was broken by the bells of the parish church ringing for the morning service. There were two of them, and their sound, familiar to us from childhood, seemed like the voices of old friends. John looked at me and said with a sigh, ""I should like to go to church. It is long since I was there. You and I have always been on Christmas mornings, Sophy, and Constance would have wished it had she been with us.""  His words, so unexpected and tender, filled my eyes with tears; not tears of grief, but of deep thankfulness to see my loved one turning once more to the old ways. It was the first time I had heard him speak of Constance, and that sweet name, with the infinite pathos of her death, and of the spectacle of my brother's weakness, so overcame me that I could not speak. [SNIPPET] The moon showed that blunted and deformed appearance which she assumes a day or two past the full, and the moisture in the air encircled her with a stormy-looking halo. We had stepped out of the dining-room windows on to the little terrace looking down towards Smedmore and Encombe. The glaucous shrubs that grow in between the balusters were wet and dripping with the salt breath of the sea, and we could hear the waves coming into the cove from the west. After standing a minute I felt chill, and proposed that we should go back to the billiard-room, where a fire was lit on all except the warmest nights. """
2226,"Mr. Yardo loaded the fish-boat with all it would take. I crawl back and return with a fifteen inch expanding beam-lever, and overuse it; the jammed trap door does not slide back in its grooves but flips right out of them, bent double; it flies off into the dark and clangs its way to rest. I am halfway through the opening when I hear the sound again. A soft slithering; a faint defeated thump. I freeze where I am, and then I hear the sigh; a long, long weary sound, almost musical. [SNIPPET] Voices and footsteps, away back among the rocks where the man came from. If the clouds part again they will see me, sure as shooting. I take a hard grip on the stretcher and scramble round the edge of the cliff. After the first gust the wind is not so bad; for the most part it is trying to press me back into the cliff. The trouble is that I can't see."
2227,"The young man took a step toward him, stumbled on his own traveling kit, and staggered across the floor for a half-dozen steps before regaining his balance. Leoh turned and saw that the youth’s face bore a somewhat ridiculous expression of mixed indecision and curiosity. “Can I help you?” Leoh asked, stopping at the edge of the moving slideway. [SNIPPET] Pale blue light streamed out. It faded and the chambermaid, popping eyes and all, was gone. It didn't hurt as much the second time. Mooney finally attracted Harse's attention, and Harse, with a Masonic pass over one of the little silvery things, set it to loosening and removing the silver bonds. The things were like toy tanks with jointed legs; as they spun the silver webs, they could also suck them in."
2228,"He called a ""conference"" of the other mecs and their circuits joined in a complicated analog: What was the probable outcome of this beginning of disharmony? There were too many variables for an immediate answer, but the query was stored in each mec's memory banks for later answer. When the mecconference began, the panel switched off and Adam walked thoughtfully through the ship's corridors. Unexpectedly, he spotted the other children. He turned quickly into a room before they saw him and ducked behind the largest of the couches. He was in the aft recroom, he realized, not having paid attention to where he was going. [SNIPPET] The soft luminescence from the Destiny's nuclear engines crept forward and caressed him. In the aft recroom, Eve and Mary were admiring Joseph's strength in being able to push the heavy couch over Adam's trapdoor. Three wall panels lit red. All the mecs appeared together. "" It's time for your science lesson,"" one said. """
2229,"It wouldn't be practical for you to stop your run now to come back to see. You couldn't do much about it anyway. I could go out to have a look and then report to you. If the way back is blocked there'll be plenty of time to work out another."" Hargedon and Zaino passed questioning glances at each other during the shorter pause that followed. ""I know there aren't,"" the voice then went on, responding to the words they could not hear, ""but it's only two or three miles, I'd say. [SNIPPET] Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck, with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind of personality that could take a crew of wild men and make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him. He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at first."
2230,"It is a tragedy that we could not clamp down the lid sooner. There are an estimated seventy million of these 'improvements on nature' now in existence. And there are many hidden establishments still producing more. Can we ever destroy them all? It is criminal to lock a human soul in such substance. If, of course, the soul truly remains human, as it was meant to be...."" [SNIPPET] Miss Mines ..."" ""She doesn't appear to be personally involved in any piratical schemes,"" Dasinger said. "" Otherwise they wouldn't have bugged her cabin and the control rooms. If we dangle a few star hyacinths before her eyes, she should be willing to fly us back.

2231,"Holk Or was doing the same, the big Jovian's battered green face almost ludicrous in astonishment. ""Now perhaps you'll tell us what this means,"" Kenniston said harshly, his mind racing. "" Have you lost your senses?"" ""I've just come to them, Kenniston,"" rapped Murdock. "" [SNIPPET] How do you feel?"" ""Fine. I could whip a wildcat and give her the first two scratches. I was a bit beat up last night, though."" ""I'll say ... but what I simply can't get over is the way you underplayed the climax. '"
2232,"For then I should find it necessary to remove you. You might stand in my way, and though you would be but a puny obstacle, you still would be an obstacle. For example, consider Ellen Estabrook, your fiancée. I can find no use for her ... and she knows as much about me as you do. [SNIPPET] And now here was Zarentzov and the teachers of the Universities, and, probably, a hundred intelligent men, who had all outstripped me! I was being left behind. And that is what happened. I need not dilate further upon it. By the end of that century I had been left behind by all the students of the world, and I never did understand Zarentzov."
2233,"The Caliph, who, notwithstanding his habitual luxury, had never before dined with so much satisfaction, gave full scope to the joy of these golden tidings, and betook himself to drinking anew. Carathis, whose antipathy to wine was by no means insuperable, failed not to supply a reason for every bumper, which they ironically quaffed to the health of Mahomet. This infernal liquor completed their impious temerity, and prompted them to utter a profusion of blasphemies; they gave a loose to their wit at the expense of the ass of Balaam, the dog of the seven sleepers, and the other animals admitted into the paradise of Mahomet. In this sprightly humour they descended the eleven thousand stairs, diverting themselves as they went at the anxious faces they saw on the square through the oilets of the tower, and at length arrived at the royal apartments by the subterranean passage. [SNIPPET] On uttering these words, which made even the Genius shudder, Vathek threw himself into the arms of Nouronihar, and commanded that his horse should be forced back to the road. There was no difficulty in obeying these orders, for the attraction had ceased; the sun shone forth in all his glory, and the shepherd vanished with a lamentable scream. The fatal impression of the music of the Genius remained, notwithstanding, in the heart of Vathek’s attendants; they viewed each other with looks of consternation; at the approach of night almost all of them escaped, and of this numerous assemblage there only remained the chief of the eunuchs, some idolatrous slaves, Dilara and a few other women, who, like herself, were votaries of the religion of the Magi. The Caliph, fired with the ambition of prescribing laws to the Intelligences of Darkness, was but little embarrassed at this dereliction; the impetuosity of his blood prevented him from sleeping, nor did he encamp any more as before."
2234,"It appeared that he had just returned from Europe. He listened to their story, smiled kindly at their perplexity, suggested that they take a vacation and forget about rats for a while, paid all their bills, and discharged them. He even went so far as to say that he was uninterested in rats, that it had just been a passing hobby and that just at present he was working on other matters. So, he asked them to pass out of his life. But he and Carol Crawford went into the wilds of Pike County and did some experimenting on his own account. [SNIPPET] In time as well as space my fancy roams far from here. It led me once to the edge of certain cliffs that were low and red and rose up out of a desert: a little way off in the desert there was a city. It was evening, and I sat and watched the city. Presently I saw men by threes and fours come softly stealing out of that city's gate to the number of about twenty. I heard the hum of men's voices speaking at evening."
2235,"And it was in this stark conglomerate of dark-souled alleys and roofs that Professor Aloys had lived all his life till just thirty-seven days ago. When he received the announcement, award, and invitation, he quickly calculated the time. It was not very long to allow travel halfway around the world. Being locked out of his rooms, as he often was, he was unencumbered by baggage or furniture, and he left for the ceremony at once. With the announcement, award, and invitation, there had also been a check; but as he was not overly familiar with the world of finance or with the English language in which it was written, he did not recognize it for what it was. Having used the back of it to write down a formula that had crept into his mind, he shoved the check, forgotten, into one of the pockets of his greatcoat. [SNIPPET] called the Comrade standing abreast of the head of the line, a thin, nervous man half a head shorter than the girl herself. Sophia Androvna Petrovitch strode forward, took a pair of trim white shorts from the neat stack at his left. ""Is that all?"" she said, looking at him. ""Yes, Comrade. Well, a woman."
2236,"I will adopt her!”  And Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but the old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt. But Karen herself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read and sew; and people said she was a nice little thing, but the looking-glass said: “Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!”  Now the queen once travelled through the land, and she had her little daughter with her. And this little daughter was a princess, and people streamed to the castle, and Karen was there also, and the little princess stood in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself be stared at; she had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid red morocco shoes. They were certainly far handsomer than those Dame Shoemaker had made for little Karen. [SNIPPET] There is the lieutenant, now, who might go quietly to bed if he chose, where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease; but does he do it? No; he saunters up and down his room, because, probably, he has enjoyed too many of the good things of this world at his dinner. That's a happy fellow! He has neither an infirm mother, nor a whole troop of everlastingly hungry children to torment him. Every evening he goes to a party, where his nice supper costs him nothing: would to Heaven I could but change with him!"
2237,"“Do I see a Penitent, or a Criminal?” She said at length; “Are those hands raised in contrition for your crimes, or in fear of meeting their punishment? Do those tears acknowledge the justice of your doom, or only solicit mitigation of your sufferings? I fear me, ’tis the latter!” [SNIPPET] Here shall you stay, and witness my sufferings; witness what it is to die in the horrors of despondency, and breathe the last groan in blasphemy and curses! And who am I to thank for this? What seduced me into crimes, whose bare remembrance makes me shudder? Fatal Witch!"
2238,"""Having got certain fundamental ideas,"" I went on, ""by combining these we might arrive at other distinct conceptions. We might build up an ideographic or glyphic language of signs—the signs being spectra. The numerals might be telegraphed by simple occultations of the light. Then from spectra we might pass by an easy step to equivalent signals of long and short flashes in various combinations, also made by occulting the light. With such a code, our correspondence might go on at great length, and present no difficulty; but, of course, we must be able to reply."" [SNIPPET] But in getting rid of it let us take care that we do not fall into the opposite error. It seems to me that if science had all its own way it would reduce man and nature to a little machine working in the corner of a big one; but I think it will cost us too dear if it make us lose our sense of the divine origin and spiritual significance of the universe."" Further argument was cut short by the car suddenly dashing into the clouds with a noiseless ease that astonished us, for they had appeared as solid as the rock. Lost in the vapours, our car seemed at rest; but although we saw nothing, we could hear a vague and distant murmur which charmed our ears after the long silence of space like a strain of music."
2239,"""And now I enjoin you to summon all your courage, for in this undertaking nothing but nerves of steel will carry you safely through."" ""I shall faithfully carry out your instructions, Almos,"" I responded, trying to appear perfectly calm, though my being fifteen hundred years behind Martian times never seemed so much a handicap as now. ""Follow me, then, word for word,"" resumed Almos. "" Understand all I say, for in the error of a second, the misconception of a word, the hesitancy of a moment, there is death! ""To-morrow, when that part of the Earth's surface on which Paris is situated appears, I shall attach the receiving apparatus of the radioscope to the lower chamber of the virator, so that the return current from Earth will flow into it. I shall then set the clockwork to turn on the current of super-radium in half an hour. [SNIPPET] The big Lensman's query was skepticism incarnate. "" It can't be done, except by an almost impossibly fortuitous accident. You yourself have been the most bitterly opposed of us all to these suicidal attempts."" ""I know it—I didn't have the solution myself until a few hours ago—it hit me all at once."
2240,"Opening the door of the aerenoid to obtain a fresh supply of air, I was at once struck with the remarkable appearance of the sky, which was intensely blue in color, but of such a dark shade as to appear almost black. It presented all the appearance of night, so many stars were visible and so brightly did they shine, while the sun blazed forth with such brilliancy from the surrounding blackness, that it was impossible to look westward without shading the eyes. I now appreciated the enormous advantage of having an atmosphere as dense as Earth's, which diffused the light to a much more comfortable extent. But the appearance of the Martian sky was magnificent, and I stood lost in admiration until, with a hardly perceptible shock, I discovered that we had come to rest upon a ledge which projected from the circular balcony of a most palatial building. [SNIPPET] I thought, and a great anguish filled my heart, as I realized the impossibility of it—and now for the first time I also realized the impossibility of life without Zarlah. A sudden dread of meeting the one I loved came upon me—a dread of seeing the light of love in her eyes, even for an instant, knowing that it was not for me. I felt I could not bear to behold the look of tenderness in her beautiful face change to one of hatred, upon learning how she had been deceived; and in my agony of spirit, I cried in a voice of deep emotion: ""Ah, Zarlah!"
2241,"Doris drew her robe about her helplessly, backing away. ""I—"" Bob began. "" That is, we—"" He broke off, glancing at Doris. Suddenly the clock began to whirr. [SNIPPET] ""No. He said that I was""— She thought for a moment—""loco. Yes, that was the word."" ""Loco?"""
2242,"I sat motionless, scarcely breathing, straining my sense to catch the first faint sound of her light, swift step; and every time a small bird, hopping along the ground, rustled a withered leaf, I started up to greet and embrace her. But she did not come; and at last, sick at heart with hope deferred, I covered my face with my hands, and, weak with misery, cried like a disappointed child.  Presently something touched me, and, removing my hands from my face, I saw that great silver-gray dog which had come to Yoletta's call when I fainted, sitting before me with his chin resting on my knees. No doubt he remembered that last wood-cutting day very well, and had come to take care of me now.  ""Welcome, dear old friend!"" said I; and in my craving for sympathy of some kind I put my arms over him, and pressed my face against his. [SNIPPET] It would appear that Benetnasch and Dubhe belong to one “current,” and Merak, Phaed, Megrez, Alioth, and Mizar to the other. As far as is known, the motion of the seven stars are not shared by the smaller stars scattered about them, but on the theory of currents there should be such a community of motion, and further investigation may reveal it. C  From the “Great Dipper” we turn to a constellation hardly less conspicuous and situated at an equal distance from the pole on the other side—Cassiopeia. This famous star-group commemorating the romantic Queen of Ethiopia whose vain boasting of her beauty was punished by the exposure of her daughter Andromeda to the “Sea Monster,” is well-marked by five stars which form an irregular letter “W” with its open side toward the pole. Three of these stars are usually ranked as of the second magnitude, and two of the third; but to ordinary observation they appear of nearly equal brightness, and present a very striking picture. They mark out the chair and a part of the figure of the beautiful queen."
2243,"NIEMAND. A doctor must always do something for the patients who come to his office seeking help. First I gave them a thorough physical examination. I turned up some minor ailments—a slight heart murmur or a trace of albumin in the urine—but nothing of any significance. On the whole they were a remarkably healthy bunch of individuals, much more so than an average sample of the population. Then I made a searching inquiry into their personal life. [SNIPPET] That is, the square under March 1st in the top row was dated March 28th in the row below it. He filled in the chart until he had an array of dozens of rows that included all our data down to May, 1958. When Middletown had finished it was easy to see that the squares of highest index number did not fall at random on the chart. Instead they fell in slightly slanting parallel series so that you could draw straight lines down through them. The connection with the Sun was obvious. LATHAM. In what way?"
2244,"It grew dark and very still. The cornice-dandruff pattered down. A few small fragments rebounded from the metal hoopskirt. Robie made some small, uncertain movements, as if feeling for broken bones. He was hunting for the traffic light, but it no longer shone either red or green. [SNIPPET] But this time I couldn't have been there eight minutes when Miss Nefer's Elizabeth-angry voice came skirling, ""Girl! Girl! Greta, where is my ruff with silver trim?"" I laid my hands on it in a flash and loped it to her, because Old Queen Liz was known to slap even her Maids [157]of Honor around a bit now and then and Miss Nefer is a bear on getting into character—a real Paul Muni. She was all made up now, I was happy to note, at least as far as her face went—I hate to see that spooky eight-spoked faint tattoo on her forehead (I've sometimes wondered if she got it acting in India or Egypt maybe). Yes, she was already all made up. This time she'd been going extra heavy on the burrowing-into-character bit, I could tell right away, even if it was only for a hacked-out anachronistic prologue."

He has had no technical training, unless you want to count a year of high school [p 62] general science. So he wasn’t too much help in explaining how Duvall’s instrument works. “And, just to make matters more juicy, Duvall kept no notes. He had total recall and a childlike fear of putting anything into writing that had not been experimentally verified.”"
2246,"So that was the way. No fair play. Once down, that was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he never went down. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred. [SNIPPET] At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were added; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away François’s breath.  “Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!” he cried. “ No, nevaire!"
2247,"Even with the low air pressure carried by spaceships, a large door area meant large total force on jamb, hinges and locks. It opened onto a small balcony from which a ladder led to the ground. The two men paused on the balcony to look over the landscape. This hadn't changed noticeably since the last time either had been out, though there might have been some small difference in the volcanic cones a couple of miles away to the northeast. The furrows down the sides of these, which looked as though they had been cut by water but were actually bone-dry ash slides, were always undergoing alteration as gas from below kept blowing fresh scoria fragments out of the craters. [SNIPPET] ""Sally, of course,"" the scientist yelped.  ""Oh, she's down in the lower pasture with Queenie,"" Johnny replied.  ""She's all right, isn't she?"" Peterson asked anxiously.  ""Oh, sure, she's fine, Doc. Why?""  ""Listen,"" Peterson said hurriedly, ""our people think they've stumbled on something."

Dr. Burkett, are you listening?"" ""Yes, Captain."" [SNIPPET] The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because we’d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise. We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists and psychiatrists why—they can give you have a dozen interesting reasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it happened to be so. We didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches, but we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would taste, and off we’d go."
2249,"And what did Flora say?”  “Miss Flora was too sweet. She said, ‘Oh, of course, of course!’—and I said the same.”  I thought a moment. “ You were too sweet, too—I can hear you all. [SNIPPET] ""Let's hunt for them,"" he suggested. "" There must be people somewhere; but perhaps they did not expect us, and so are not at hand to give us a welcome.""      They now made a more careful examination of the country around them."

[SNIPPET] The bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent, and become gradually enveloped in thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin; or a webbed foot might have all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to any extent, and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent, so as to serve as a wing: yet in all this great amount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of the several parts. If we suppose that the ancient progenitor, the archetype as it may be called, of all mammals, had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose they served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the whole class. So with the mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pair of maxillæ, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and then natural selection, acting on some originally created form, will account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost, by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts, by the soldering together of other parts, and by the doubling or multiplication of others,—variations which we know to be within the limits of possibility. In the paddles of the extinct gigantic sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the [436]general pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured. There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual."
2251,"Civil authorities have forbidden further plane travel indefinitely because of the danger of spasms at the controls, and it is rumored that all vehicular transport whatsoever is to come under the same ban. No Rocklipper has arrived from Lunn for over a week, and it is thirty-six hours since we have made contact with the Lunn telestation. Yurp has been silent for over two days, and Asia a week.

2252,"No naturalist can have worked at any group without being struck with this fact; and it has been fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author. It will suffice to quote the highest authority, Robert Brown, who in speaking of certain organs in the Proteaceæ, says their generic importance, ""like that of all their parts, not only in this but, as I apprehend, in every natural family, is very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost."" Again in another work he says, the genera of the Connaraceæ ""differ in having one or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or valvular æstivation. Any one of these characters singly is frequently of more than generic importance, though here even when all taken together they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from Connarus."" To give an example amongst insects, in one great division of the Hymenoptera, the antennæ, as Westwood has remarked, are most constant in structure; [416]in another division they differ much, and the differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no one probably will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological importance. Any number of instances could be given of the varying importance for classification of the same important organ within the same group of beings. [SNIPPET] No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after having been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of generations. But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed for many generations—some say, for a dozen or even a score of generations. After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a common expression, of any one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood. In a breed which has not been crossed, but in which both parents have lost some character which their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce the lost character might be, as was formerly remarked, for all that we can see to the contrary, transmitted for almost any number of generations. When a character which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of generations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that the offspring suddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations [161]distant, but that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to reproduce the character in question, which at last, under unknown favourable conditions, gains an ascendancy. For instance, it is probable that in each generation of the barb-pigeon, which produces most rarely a blue and black-barred bird, there has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assume this colour."

Later, with many cameras and millions of people watching, Kieran's body, in a pressure-suit, was ceremoniously taken to a selected position where it would orbit the Moon. All suggestions of the funerary were carefully avoided. The space-struck man—nobody at all referred to him as ""dead""—would remain in this position until a revival process was perfected. ""Until forever,"" thought Hausman, watching sourly. "" I suppose Garces is right."

At first, thinking coldly, Copeland was sure they'd wilt and die long before they got near the Moon. [SNIPPET] The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked bulk. The constellations were unrecognizable. The rodent city was a glowing expanse of shallow, crystalline domes, set among odd, scrub trees and bushes. The crags loomed on all sides, all their jaggedness lost after a million years of erosion under an ocean that was gone."

Towmotors scuttled across the landing area at Marsport, shifting the cargo that had been destined for the Radiant Hope from the helpless G-boat to a jet cargo-plane. Nearby, watching the operation, were Jonner and Deveet, with the Marsport agent of Mars Air Transport Company. ""We didn't know Atom-Star was the one chartering the plane until you ordered the G-boat cargo loaded on it,"" confessed the Mars-Air agent. ""I see you and Mr. Deveet are signed up to accompany the cargo. You'll have to rent suits for the trip. We have to play it safe, and there's always the possibility of a forced landing."""

2260,"His entire body, even his face, was imbedded in it. He was certain that he would smother—yet the impulse to breathe was subdued. Fighting the sticky stuff, he knew that he possessed great strength—relatively. Some of this was the android power in him. Perhaps more of it was the increased relative toughness of everything, in lesser size. An ant was relatively stronger than a man—a phenomenon of smaller dimensions.

""Very different, Master. You made many changes. [SNIPPET] Now it was Weaver who taught, and they who learned. This, Weaver felt, was as it should be. These creatures were not men, he told himself; he would give himself no illusions on that score; but they might still be capable of learning many things that he had to teach. He could do a great deal of good, even if it turned out that he could never return to Earth. He rather suspected that they had no spaceships. There was something about their life—the small villages, the slowly drifting aircars, the absence of noise and smell and dirt, that somehow did not fit with the idea of space travel."
2263,"It boasted a population of quite fifteen hundred souls, and this, with its importance as a trading centre, made it a notable municipality for these latter days. Its appearance, however, does not call for any extended description; assuredly, it was not imposing. A heterogeneous jumble of low, half-timbered houses and mud-plastered hovels; dirty, unpaved streets, a mean-looking market-place, where the shrill clamor of huckstering never seemed to cease; some pretentious-looking public buildings, with stuccoed fronts; outside of all, the inevitable earth rampart, topped by a palisade and pierced by sally-ports at the cardinal points—such was Croye, the principal city of this western hemisphere in the year 2015, or ninety since the Great Change. Constans frowned as he gazed upon this unlovely picture. Yet he determined that he would find something of good in it, and as though answering his thought, the sun reappeared at that very moment from behind a passing cloud, its rays lighting up the red tiling used as roofing in the houses of the better class—the one note of cheerful color among these dingy browns and grays. It was an omen, and he accepted it as such. [SNIPPET] This being so, we went to dinner, and made very great haste through it; and, after that, every one of us worked at the line, and so in about an hour we had sufficient; for I had estimated that it would not be wise to make the attempt with a less length than five hundred fathoms. Having now completed a sufficiency of the line, the bo'sun set one of the men to flake it down very carefully upon the rock beside the bow, whilst he himself tested it at all such parts as he thought in any way doubtful, and so, presently, all was ready. Then I bent it on to the arrow, and, having set the bow whilst the men were flaking down the line, I was prepared immediately to discharge the weapon. Now, all the morning, a man upon the hulk had observed us through a spy-glass, from a position that brought his head just above the edge of the superstructure, and, being aware of our intentions—having watched the previous flights—he understood the bo'sun, when he beckoned to him, that we had made ready for a third shot, and so, with an answering wave of his spy-glass, he disappeared from our sight. At that, having first turned to see that all were clear of the line, I pressed down the trigger, my heart beating very fast and thick, and so in a moment the arrow was sped. But now, doubtless because of the weight of the line, it made nowhere near so good a flight as on the previous occasion, the arrow striking the weed some two hundred yards short of the hulk, and at this, I could near have wept with vexation and disappointment."
2264,"The men took positions behind a curving line of rifle pits that had been turned up, like a large furrow, along the line of woods. Before them was a level stretch, peopled with short, deformed stumps. From the woods beyond came the dull popping of the skirmishers and pickets, firing in the fog. From the right came the noise of a terrific fracas.  The men cuddled behind the small embankment and sat in easy attitudes awaiting their turn. [SNIPPET] Within him something bade to cry out. He had the impulse to make a rallying speech, to sing a battle hymn, but he could only get his tongue to call into the air: “Why—why—what—what’s th’ matter?”  Soon he was in the midst of them. They were leaping and scampering all about him. Their blanched faces shone in the dusk. They seemed, for the most part, to be very burly men. The youth turned from one to another of them as they galloped along."
2265,"He had been close to it and become familiar with it.  When, however, they began to pass into a new region, his old fears of stupidity and incompetence reassailed him, but this time he doggedly let them babble. He was occupied with his problem, and in his desperation he concluded that the stupidity did not greatly matter.  Once he thought he had concluded that it would be better to get killed directly and end his troubles. Regarding death thus out of the corner of his eye, he conceived it to be nothing but rest, and he was filled with a momentary astonishment that he should have made an extraordinary commotion over the mere matter of getting killed. [SNIPPET] ""What bargain did you make with this Llosir? What was the price?"" ""No bargain was made.

It took him a long time before he could bring himself to believe that this king of finance was the brother whom he had imagined finding derelict and penniless. Instead, he was rich and oblivious, not needing anything the younger man could give him. It was then that Alard determined revenge. [SNIPPET] I didn't want Ven to shoot, but I couldn't close the airlock with her inside it. So I stood, hesitating while the group of gaily dressed mammals came toward us through the trees, their high voices loud in the stillness.

Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.

The automated files selected three microcard dossiers that matched the requirements of the order. The three microcards and the order itself appeared simultaneously on the desktop viewer of the Star Watch personnel officer. He looked at the order, then read the dossiers.

2273,"Rest here, and keep your mind at peace. You will be safe."" Then he turned and left. I was puzzled for a while, but I forgot that shortly in the strangeness and wonder of the life I was living in a strange world. And the lake? Melbourne? [SNIPPET] ""They call this whisky nowadays!"" he observed absently, with quiet irony. I wanted to hear the rest of his account. ""Go on with your story, sir,"" I begged him. ""The rest is simple enough—but it's the meat of the narrative."
2274,"“Well, I don’t know. It’s awkward and would make me ashamed.”  “And I know why she’d be ashamed,” said Pétya, offended by Natásha’s previous remark. “ It’s because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles” (that was how Pétya described his namesake, the new Count Bezúkhov) “and now she’s in love with that singer” (he meant Natásha’s Italian singing master), “that’s why she’s ashamed!” [SNIPPET] “Well, now to the health of handsome women!” said Dólokhov, and with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.  “Here’s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin—and their lovers!” he added.  Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at Dólokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets with Kutúzov’s cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the principal guests."
2275,"He did so, sir, by twisting his mouth at me, and remarking that such sublime and ridiculous sophistry never came out of another mouth but one (meaning yours) and that no oath before a kirk session was necessary to prove who was my dad, for that he had never seen a son so like a father as I was like mine.""  ""He durst not for his soul's salvation, and for his daily bread, which he values much more, say such a word, boy; therefore, take care what you assert,"" said my reverend father.  ""He said these very words, and will not deny them, sir,"" said I  My reverend father turned about in great wrath and indignation, and went away in search of John, but I kept out of the way, and listened at a back window; for John was dressing the plot of ground behind the house; and I hope it was no sin in me that I did rejoice in the dialogue which took place, it being the victory of righteousness over error.  ""Well, John, this is a fine day for your delving work."" [SNIPPET] George said he seemed to have some demon for a familiar. Dal answered that he did not wonder a bit at that, for the young spark was the third in a direct line who had all been children of adultery; and it was well known that all such were born half-deils themselves, and nothing was more likely than that they should hold intercourse with their fellows. In the same style did he sympathize with all his son's late sufferings and perplexities.  In Mr. Adam Gordon, however, George found a friend who entered into all his feelings, and had seen and known everything about the matter."
2276,"Come on, let's go up to the loft."" They clambered up the wooden stairs and Red hooked the cage toward them. Slim pointed and said, ""There's sort of a hole in the canvas."" Red frowned. "" How'd that get there?"" He lifted the canvas, looked in, and said, with relief, ""They're still there."" ""The canvas appeared to be burned,"" worried Slim. [SNIPPET] This might be one of his brood."" That was how they entered their present prison. They had carefully burnt away a portion of the thick, stiff covering and it was obvious that the height from which they were suspended was a killing one. Now, once again, the prison-cage shuddered and lifted in an upward arc."
2277,"To-morrow, dearest, I shall return to you with good news."" ""Ah! Harold, you do not see the impossibility of such a thing—you cannot behold it through a woman's eyes. No, no! I can never see Almos again! I gave my love to you through his medium, and to see him when you were absent would be greater agony than I could bear. I must go with you, Harold, to the world in which you live, where I can have you always."" [SNIPPET] It was useless for me to try to understand such thoughts, and to banish them from my mind was impossible. I was overcome with a sense of loneliness. Looking at my watch, I found that it was already past the hour when Mars would be visible through the window on a clear night, but, alas, the sky showed no signs of clearing; though my instrument stood ready, it was useless. But, obeying some irresistible impulse, I decided to turn on the current and stand by the instrument in case an opening in the clouds should occur, for even a moment. I therefore turned the switch that controlled the current, and immediately, to my astonishment, the surface of wires became as brilliant as on the previous evening under a clear sky. Turning away for a moment, to allow my eyes to become accustomed to the brilliancy, I noticed that the sky was still overcast with heavy rain clouds. My joy at the discovery that the Martian projecting agent was not arrested by vapor was unbounded, for it meant that I could be in wave-contact with Mars every night, during the period that the planet was visible from Earth."
2278,"Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to place the gift around his neck. ""Tomboldo,"" he said, pointing to himself. Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud, ""Tomboldo."" We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then, as the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each breathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of them. [SNIPPET] Miss Anna Van Tromp offered him a cup of milk, which he accepted, thanking her profusely. She talked volubly, eyeing him all the while with the utmost curiosity, and he gathered presently that her father had made several attempts to marry her off, disapproving of her solitary residence so far from the center of the city; but she had frowned upon one and all of the suitors he had encouraged to call on her. She was undeniably impressive, almost formidable, he conceded privately, with a touch of the shrew and harridan. Life with Miss Anna Van Tromp would not be easy, he reflected. But then, life with his sister Julie was not easy, either. Miss Anna, however, had not to face atomic warfare; all she had to look forward to in fourteen years was surrender to the besieging British, which she would have no trouble in surviving. He settled down to his ingratiating best and succeeded in making a most favorable impression on Miss Anna Van Tromp before at last he took his leave, carrying with him a fine, hand-wrought bowl with which the lady had presented him."
2279,"You see he ought to have said that sooner; for the moment he expressed the wish his head was free; and cured of all his paroxysms of love, he hastened off to his room, where the pains consequent on the fright the Shoes had prepared for him, did not so soon take their leave.  But you must not think that the affair is over now; it grows much worse.  The night passed, the next day also; but nobody came to fetch the Shoes.  In the evening “Dramatic Readings” were to be given at the little theatre in King Street. [SNIPPET] There stood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely forgotten.  “'Tis now winter out-of-doors!” thought the Tree. “ The earth is hard and covered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I have been put up here under shelter till the spring-time comes! How thoughtful that is!"
2280,"“How am I?” Dólokhov answered coldly. “ I am as you see.”  The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherkóv spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dólokhov’s reply.  “And how do you get on with the officers?” inquired Zherkóv. [SNIPPET] ""I'll wager you what you like, now, that I'll handle a corpse and drive a screw in a coffin as well as you, now, although you are so solid and miserable. ""—""So you may—so you may."" ""Then what do you mean by saying I haven't a proper regard for my profession?""—""I say you haven't, and there's the thing that shall prove it—you don't look it, and that's the truth."" ""I don't look like an undertaker! indeed I dare say I don't if I ain't dressed like one."
2281,"No one had ever thought Pettingill deficient in ideas, and this was his opportunity. The only drawback was the time limit which Brewster so remorselessly fixed. Without that he felt that he could have done something splendid in the way of decorative panels—something that would make even the glory of Puvis de Chavannes turn pallid. With it he was obliged to curb his turbulent ideas, and he decided that a rich simplicity was the proper note. The result was gorgeous, but not too gorgeous,—it had depth and distinction. [SNIPPET] I laughed. ""I think so,"" said Remington Solander gravely. "" I do think so, indeed! And now, sir, we come to the important part. You, as I know, are a trustee of the cemetery."" ""Yes,"" I said, ""I am."""
2282,"What should I do now, Bob?"" ""Get the salt,"" Bob instructed. He poured sardine oil from the can into the juicer, being very careful not to let the sardines fall in. When he had squeezed the last drop of oil out of the can, he ate all the sardines and tossed the can into the sink. Bonnie went after the salt and, when she lifted out the box, she found a package containing two chocolate graham crackers. ""Mom has a new hiding place, Bob,"" she announced. Bob looked up. "" [SNIPPET] The noises kept going on. Mrs. Burroughs was alarmed because he did not answer her knock at mealtimes, and one morning she charged upstairs and hollered at him through the door. ""You stop your nonsense this minute and come down to breakfast!"" ""I'm not hungry,"" he called back. ""You open this door!"" she ordered and, by George, he did. "" Your whiskaboom or whatever it is will keep till after breakfast."""
2283,"I’ll go for one.” Jack said he would—and then another—and, in a word, they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo and I, with the third man, went back to the boat, where we told them we would stay for them, and take care to take in as many of them as should be left; for I told them it was a mad thing they were going about, and supposed most of them would have the fate of Tom Jeffry. They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come off again, and they would take care, &c.; so away they went. I entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their own, and that they were entrusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for want of their help, and that they could not answer for it to God or man. [SNIPPET] Now, for myself, I profess to be of the former sort, and therefore having the modern inclination to expatiate upon the beauty of my own productions, and display the bright parts of my discourse, I thought best to do it in the body of the work, where as it now lies it makes a very considerable addition to the bulk of the volume, a circumstance by no means to be neglected by a skilful writer. Having thus paid my due deference and acknowledgment to an established custom of our newest authors, by a long digression unsought for and a universal censure unprovoked, by forcing into the light, with much pains and dexterity, my own excellences and other men’s defaults, with great justice to myself and candour to them, I now happily resume my subject, to the infinite satisfaction both of the reader and the author. We left Lord Peter in open rupture with his two brethren, both for ever discarded from his house, and resigned to the wide world with little or nothing to trust to. Which are circumstances that render them proper subjects for the charity of a writer’s pen to work on, scenes of misery ever affording the fairest harvest for great adventures."
2284,"""Doctor Turner,"" the man said. "" What do you think of this idea of using the Man from Mars as the male donor?"" ""You mean Captain Jack Harmon of the Space Force?"" ""Yes. [SNIPPET] Above the stairs towered the great statue of a man on horseback. He was dressed in a sort of tunic, and in his uplifted arm he carried a scroll as if for the people to read. His face was turned toward me, and I marveled even in that wild moment that the unknown sculptor could have caught such an expression of appeal. I can see the high intellectual brow as if it were before me at this moment—the level, sympathetic eyes and the firm chin. Then something moving caught my eyes, and I swear I saw a child—a living child coming from the burning city—running madly, breathlessly from a wave of glowing lava that threatened to engulf him at any moment."
2285,"Nobody can shake one!"" Mumbling incoherently, he grabbed a spacesuit and began to don it. The room was suddenly a seething mass of confusion. The pilots distributed spacesuits and helped passengers into them while the cabin continued to sway and lurch. [SNIPPET] Now, if I could talk to your captain—or, are you the captain?"" The Cirissin replied, ""I spoke man. Name Orealgrailbliqu. Capitate nod sparking merry can languish. I only earning languish. Gut, hah? Tree whacks."""
2286,"He yelled again, ""Food!"" The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She pointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child. ""Food!"" said the last woman on earth. [SNIPPET] The Aurigean was nowhere to be seen; the door behind which he had disappeared was still closed. Weaver got up, stripped off his spacesuit, and, by hammering with the sole of one of the boots, managed to straighten out the dent in the back of the helmet. He put the suit back on, then looked doubtfully at the control board. It wouldn't do to go on pulling things at random; he might cause some damage. Tentatively, he pushed a slide he remembered touching before. When nothing happened, he pushed it back. He tried a knob, then a lever."
2287,"Noaks!” he cried. The boots paused, then clumped down again. The door opened and disclosed that homely figure which Zuleika had seen on her way to Judas.  Sensitive reader, start not at the apparition! [SNIPPET] He saw the justice in her protest. "" A quiet little dinner in some out of the way place would be joyous,"" she added, persuasively.  ""You're right, Peggy, you're always right. You see, I'm so used to spending money by the handful that I don't know how to do it any other way."
2288,"When the helmet of the apparatus was removed from Eddie's head, the police had certain comments of Mitchell Prell's to study. Possibly they could puzzle out some of their hidden meaning. But this couldn't have satisfied them very much. The next day the letter Prell had mentioned arrived. At least it could be assumed that it was the one. [SNIPPET] Now a more rugged body only made the drives stronger and the outcome more sure. Still orbiting around this first colonial world, outside the old solar system and linked to the history of Earth, was the star ship, kept always in careful order. But on a small, jagged moon, a larger, better craft was under construction. It would have thrilled ancient blood; it could stir an android more. Something sultry began to ache in Ed Dukas's mind at the thought of restraint. ""Some of us will have to go on, Babs,"" he said one dwarf-lit half-night. "" Blame it on fundamental biological law—in me, and the boys, too."
2289,"Just the same, permit me to congratulate you on your virginity."" ""Thanks,"" she said, in a voice not untinged with pride. ""However,"" I went on, ""in spite of certain contra-indications and irregularities of symptoms such as the absence of morning sickness and the like, I would like to enlist your cooperation in delivering yourself of an infant within the next three months."" ""Dr. Foley, please understand!"" She threw her hands apart in despair. "" I love children. [SNIPPET] We huddled about our dying fire of bones and stray logs. We said nothing. We just sat, in deep, wordless, thoughtless silence. We were the last outpost of Mankind."
2290,"The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was to get us acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who were in the town, and who had been there some time converting the people to Christianity; but we thought they made but poor work of it, and made them but sorry Christians when they had done. One of these was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon; another was a Portuguese; and a third a Genoese. Father Simon was courteous, and very agreeable company; but the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work they came about, viz. to talk with and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants wherever they had opportunity. We often ate and drank with those men; and though I must confess the conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so far from the true conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little more than letting them know the name of Christ, and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they understood not, and to cross themselves, and the like; yet it must be confessed that the religionists, whom we call missionaries, have a firm belief that these people will be saved, and that they are the instruments of it; and on this account they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage, and the hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes death itself, and the most violent tortures, for the sake of this work. [SNIPPET] The continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying island, passes under the general name of Balnibarbi; and the metropolis, as I said before, is called Lagado. I felt some little satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground. I walked to the city without any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and sufficiently instructed to converse with them. I soon found out the person’s house to whom I was recommended, presented my letter from his friend the grandee in the island, and was received with much kindness. This great lord, whose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his own house, where I continued during my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable manner.  The next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the town, which is about half the bigness of London; but the houses very strangely built, and most of them out of repair. The people in the streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in rags."
2291,"""I didn't say it would be me!"" said the Captain sharply. ""Didn't you?"" When the Captain had no answer, Paresi asked him, ""Then why wonder about a thing like that?"" [SNIPPET] That was the beginning. I checked with the mirror for the last time and decided that I would pass muster. As far as I could see, I looked like almost any college student. There wasn't anything I could do about my hair. It hadn't grown at all. It was a mass of short, black ringlets that fit my head like a tight cap."
2292,"""It always does that,"" Rapp said. "" No matter which way I put the set, the picture's always upside down."" ""No, man,"" the repairman said, pleadingly. "" Look, I took a course. I mean, the best school, you dig? It don't work that way. It just can't."" [SNIPPET] Not that I know of."" He regarded the inverted picture for a moment. Then, as the repairman's words began to sink in, Mr. Rapp looked at him apprehensively. ""Witches?"""
2293,"He says he can still remember the way our linear gravitation felt inside when we landed."" ""Well,"" Joyce said firmly, ""he'll just have to fight it, that's all. If a person let that kind of neurotic impulse rule his life, he'd be completely demoralized in no time."" Four glanced over his shoulder at Joyce, as if to see if she were joking. Shaking his head, he returned to the computer's innards. [SNIPPET] He sighed. "" I got it figured out, Four,"" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. "" A missionary takes over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and—"" ""Not now, Grampa,"" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making the grand tour of the cabin."
2294,"At every step I found myself stopped by the imperfections of my instruments. Like all active microscopists, I gave my imagination full play. Indeed, it is a common complaint against many such, that they supply the defects of their instruments with the creations of their brains. I imagined depths beyond depths in nature which the limited power of my lenses prohibited me from exploring. I lay awake at night constructing imaginary microscopes of immeasurable power, with which I seemed to pierce through all the envelopes of matter down to its original atom. How I cursed those imperfect mediums which necessity through ignorance compelled me to use! How I longed to discover the secret of some perfect lens, whose magnifying power should be limited only by the resolvability of the object, and which at the same time should be free from spherical and chromatic aberrations, in short from all the obstacles over which the poor microscopist finds himself continually stumbling! [SNIPPET] You are fortunate."" She then continued, ""Will the spirits communicate with this gentleman?"" Vigorous affirmative. ""Will the particular spirit he desires to speak with communicate?"" A very confused rapping followed this question. ""I know what they mean,"" said Mrs. Vulpes, addressing herself to me; ""they wish you to write down the name of the particular spirit that you desire to converse with. Is that so?"""
2295,"follow the edge Of the rushing rill, Over the bridge And by the mill, Then into the woods beyond On the left where lies the plank Over the pond. Seize hold of it quick! To rise 'tis trying, It struggles still! Rescue! rescue! [SNIPPET] Could I but claim the ear-rings only! A different figure one would make. What's beauty worth to thee, young blood! May all be very well and good; What then? ' Tis half for pity's sake They praise your pretty features."
2296,"""I'll tell him,"" Wilkerson said grimly. "" The question is—will he act on what I tell him."" Molock's eyes went to Rita. "" Honey, I want you to get those cameras going and keep them going. I want this recorded for posterity, if for nobody else."" Rita was shaken and scared. [SNIPPET] It wasn't six months before I saw the thing starting off. That was when I was invited to Garrity's second wedding. It was in Terra City, and when he asked me to come down with him for a witness, I assumed it would be the girl he had been busily courting before he went to Serco. But when I walked into the marriage registry office and took a look at the girl, I got a clear, horrific idea of just what Katha had done to Garrity. He didn't think anything had been done to him. He was all smiles. He brought the girl toward me, proud and possessive, grinning all over his face."
2297,"grated Tanub. “You write finish for your entire planet if you do,” said Orne. “ I’m not alone. There are others listening to every word we say. There’s a ship overhead that could split open your planet with one bomb—wash it with molten rock. [SNIPPET] The music had a curious rhythm that suggested figures dancing wildly around firelight. She struck a final chord, muted the strings. ""That makes me homesick,"" said Orne. ""Oh!"" She whirled, gasped, then smiled. "" You startled me. I thought I was alone."""
2298,"I am suddenly immensely hungry and dial breakfast all over again. Just as I finish M'Clare's voice starts once more. ""It's always the minor matters that cause the most difficulty. The timing of this announcement has cost me as much thought as any aspect of the arrangements. [SNIPPET] This compartment is divided by a partition and the door through that is open. There will be another door into the nose on the other side. I bring back my feet ready to kick off on a dive through that doorway. Behind me, something stirs. My muscles go into a spasm like the one that causes a falling dream, my hold tears loose and I go tumbling through the air, rebound from a wall, twist, and manage to hook one foot in the frame of the door I was aiming for. I pull myself down and turn off the antigrav; then I just shake for a bit."
2299,"""Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face ... that haff face on top of it ... that face with the red eyes an' crinkly albino hair, an' no chin, like the Whateleys.... It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o' thing, but they was a haff-shaped man's face on top of it, an' it looked like Wizard Whateley's, only it was yards an' yards acrost...."" He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon Whateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore, spoke aloud. ""Fifteen year' gone,"" he rambled, ""I heerd Ol' Whateley say as haow some day we'd hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill...."" [SNIPPET] This much I knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show me the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation. In my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled and terrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered. We boys used to overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere and odor of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders. The small-paned windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall-paper, falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of the fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend the ladder to the attic, a vast raftered length lighted only by small blinking windows in the gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage of chests, chairs, and spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposit had shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes. But after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house."
2300,"And this growing very dreadful, and the world full of lawlessness and degeneracy, there had banded together the sound millions, and built the Last Redoubt; there in the twilight of the world—so it seems to us, and yet to them (bred at last to the peace of usage) as it were the Beginning; and this I can make no clearer; and none hath right to expect it; for my task is very great, and beyond the power of human skill. And when the humans had built the great Pyramid, it had one thousand three hundred and twenty floors; and the thickness of each floor was according to the strength of its need. And the whole height of this pyramid exceeded seven miles, by near a mile, and above it was a tower from which the Watchmen looked (these being called the Monstruwacans). But where the Redoubt was built, I know not; save that I believe in a mighty valley, of which I may tell more in due time. And when the Pyramid was built, the last millions, who were the Builders thereof, went within, and made themselves a great house and city of this Last Redoubt. And thus began the Second History of this world. [SNIPPET] And all the while as I dropped from ledge to ledge, I was full of torment to know whether the monster had returned. The bo'sun was the first man to reach the bottom of the cleft, and he set off immediately round the base of the rock to the beach, the rest of us following him as we made safe our footing in the valley. I was the third man down; but, being light and fleet of foot, I passed the second man and caught up with the bo'sun just as he came upon the sand. Here, I found that the boat was within some five fathoms of the beach, and I could see Job still lying insensible; but of the monster there was no sign. And so matters were, the boat nearly a dozen yards from the shore, and Job lying insensible in her; with, somewhere near under her keel (for all that we knew) a great monster, and we helpless upon the beach."
2301,"There they were ushered into a huge office. They found Mr. Hoppy Davery lounging on a divan the size of a space-port. He was youthful in appearance, as were all Earthmen, but a soft plumpness and a receding hairline made him look slightly older than average. He pointed a rigid finger at Malcomb and Gavir. "" I want you two to hear a condensed recording of statements taken from calls we received last night."" Gavir stiffened. [SNIPPET] Of course, they might still have to kill him. He already knew enough about them to send them all to the stake if he ever spoke out. He must be brought under control, to serve their purposes, or he must quietly disappear. ""So, you not only spy on us, but you lie about us,"" said Daoud. "" And to whom do you send these lies? When the Bulgarian woman Ana takes your weekly reports back to the Palazzo Monaldeschi, to whom does she deliver them? De Verceuil?"
2302,"Could they fail to see that it was their perfect concert of action, their organization under one control, which made these men the tremendous engine they were, able to vanquish a mob ten times as numerous? Seeing this so plainly, could they fail to compare the scientific manner in which the nation went to war with the unscientific manner in which it went to work? Would they not query since what time the killing of men had been a task so much more important than feeding and clothing them, that a trained army should be deemed alone adequate to the former, while the latter was left to a mob?  It was now toward nightfall, and the streets were thronged with the workers from the stores, the shops, and mills. [SNIPPET] ""The faculty of education,"" Dr. Leete explained, ""is held to the same responsibility for the bodies as for the minds of its charges. The highest possible physical, as well as mental, development of every one is the double object of a curriculum which lasts from the age of six to that of twenty-one.""  The magnificent health of the young people in the schools impressed me strongly. My previous observations, not only of the notable personal endowments of the family of my host, but of the people I had seen in my walks abroad, had already suggested the idea that there must have been something like a general improvement in the physical standard of the race since my day, and now, as I compared these stalwart young men and fresh, vigorous maidens with the young people I had seen in the schools of the nineteenth century, I was moved to impart my thought to Dr. Leete. He listened with great interest to what I said.  ""Your testimony on this point,"" he declared, ""is invaluable. We believe that there has been such an improvement as you speak of, but of course it could only be a matter of theory with us."
2303,"""Ladies—"" he inclined his photocells toward Rose Thinker and Meg—""and gentlemen. This is a historic occasion in Old Puffy's long history, the inauguration of the helium-filled loaf ('So Light It Almost Floats Away!') in which that inert and heaven-aspiring gas replaces old-fashioned carbon dioxide. Later, there will be kudos for Rose Thinker, whose bright relays genius-sparked the idea, and also for Roger Snedden, who took care of the details. ""By the by, Racehorse, that was a brilliant piece of work getting the helium out of the government—they've been pretty stuffy lately about their monopoly. But first I want to throw wide the casement in your minds that opens on the Long View of Things."" Rose Thinker spun twice on her chair and opened her photocells wide. [SNIPPET] He tossed and squirmed. Once more the voice called, and this time he decided that he must be asleep. He struggled to open his eyes, then finally blinked them wide in an effort to adjust himself to his surroundings. He was apparently out in the open, and it was night."
2304,"NIEMAND. Scores of them. LATHAM. What is your opinion of these correlations? NIEMAND. Pure bosh in most cases. [SNIPPET] That is, if you see a large spot at the center of the Sun's disk today, there is a good chance if it survives that you will see it at the same place twenty-seven days later. But that night Middletown produced another chart that showed the connection with the Sun in a way that was even more convincing. LATHAM. How was that?"
2305,"""The next part is the thing I don't understand,"" the girl said. ""Well,"" said the man, ""as I get it, they found that any piece of matter that has been part of an organism, retains a physical 'memory' of the entire structure of the organism of which it was part. And that they could reconstruct that structure from a part of a person, if that was all there was left of him. From there it was just a matter of pushing the process back through time. They had to teach me a whole new language to explain that one."" ""Isn't it wonderful that intergalactic travel gives us room to expand?"" said the girl. "" [SNIPPET] My sort of people, though, tend to cuddle like puppies, or like cattle in a thunderstorm; we take comfort in the closeness of other humans. We're not erotic about this, Johnny. Not necessarily erotic, I mean. We have our moments, too, or the Shrinkers would long since have taken over the world in spite of their dreadful handicap. We're the people who make brilliant barbers. The kind who say hello to you with a Roman handshake and a clasp on the shoulder."
2306,"He went through some routine motions, his moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening. The girl approached him. Two other persons appeared from somewhere back of her.... Three.... Four.... Five. ""Where do they come from?"" [SNIPPET] I didn't answer. The vertical surfaces of the scales folded together, parted, folded again, with the motions of the great creature, and for a moment I lost sight of Vauna. But I could hear her voice as I fought my way down to her hiding place. She was talking through the radio with Campbell."
2307,"Mecteacher detected a covert wince from Adam's monitor. The teacher appeared to Adam on his desk panel where the others couldn't see or hear. "" Do not think this is because she is not—deep, Adam. She is only seven and not as advanced for her age as you are. [SNIPPET] She built a bower, an attractive courtship custom that had been adopted from the birds, and the day ended much more pleasantly than Scientist Norcross had expected at lunch. The reports came in from Prime Center. Drumstetter stayed in Los Angeles two days, in San Francisco three, and then consulted with Dowson in Honolulu. He skipped to New Zealand, back north to Japan, and swung across Siberia with short stops at various laboratories and universities. He was in Finland for three days with old Scientist Theophil Gertsley, who, though little better than a witch doctor, called himself a psychologist. When John Davis Drumstetter set his skip down beside the live oak tree, Scientist Norcross and Monica Drake Lane were waiting for him. He was gaunt from hunger and weary from travel, but the expression in his eyes was not one to be assuaged by any food cubicle."
2308,"""I'll tell you,"" said Garrity. "" I haven't seen a woman yet that wouldn't cost you more than she was worth in the long run."" ""Long run?"" I asked him. "" We don't spend more than a few days down on Seranis. Isn't going to be any long run. If she runs, let her to catch her before takeoff time."" [SNIPPET] Then the screen want gray, and a panel of lettering appeared, shaking slightly. OUR PICTURE HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY INTERRUPTED. NORMAL SERVICE WILL BE RESTORED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PLEASE STAND BY. ""I was going to give you a bill,"" the repairman said. "" Only maybe we better just charge it up to customer relations."" The letters remained steady on the screen, and Mr. Rapp studied them."
2309,"But the tone was wrong. It was high, shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical. Ned's gaze searched for the source of the voice—located the black box just outside of his crystal vat. From that box the voice seemed to have originated. [SNIPPET] ""Not for myself,"" Simone mumbled, and looked again toward the garden where her daughter was doing something with three stones and a pie plate full of spring water. ""I do despair of Nina,"" Cecily said, as she had said before. "" She's four, and has no appearance. Not even balance. She fell out of the applerose tree, and couldn't even help herself."" Suddenly the old woman thrust her face close to her granddaughter."
2310,"It hadn't hurt anything, had it? Well, no, it hadn't. But as you can imagine, things happened rather fast. They let Solomon get clean denims and his razor. Then without a bye-your-leave, hustled him to the Ontario airport where an unmarked jet flew him to Washington and a hurriedly arranged meeting with the President. They left guards posted inside the fence of Solomon's yard, so they'll cause no attention while protecting his property. A rugged individual sits in the office and tells buyers and sellers alike, that he is Solomon's nephew. "" [SNIPPET] A faint moan came from the courtyard, and I flashed the lamp down. The dog, flung bodily from the porch, stirred feebly and stiffened. Its neck was broken. There on the shadowed veranda, with the bright African moon shining pitilessly down upon the hot, dank, fevered earth, the three of us swore nervously while we stood with our rifles pointing in as many directions, hoping, even praying for that monstrous ape to rush upon us. ""He must have gone somewhere!"""
2311,"She led him gently along the cliffs, then down to the beach; their arms linked in one another’s, they had still so much to say that lay just outside that secret orchard of theirs.    The afternoon was rapidly drawing to a close; and a long, chilly English summer’s evening was throwing a misty pall over the green Kentish landscape.  The Day Dream had set sail, and Marguerite Blakeney stood alone on the edge of the cliff for over an hour, watching those white sails, which bore so swiftly away from her the only being who really cared for her, whom she dared to love, whom she knew she could trust.  Some little distance away to her left the lights from the coffee-room of “The Fisherman’s Rest” glittered yellow in the gathering mist; from time to time it seemed to her aching nerves as if she could catch from thence the sound of merry-making and of jovial talk, or even that perpetual, senseless laugh of her husband’s, which grated continually upon her sensitive ears. [SNIPPET] Turn it to delight. That may be one way out. In a little while, if you have any brains worth thinking about, you will be satisfied, and then you will come up here to the greater things. The old religions and their new offsets want still, I see, to suppress all these things. Let them suppress."
2312,"A row of lights on the desk console began blinking on and off, one, two, three ... down to the end of the row, then back to the beginning again, on and off, on and off . And then, somehow, he could see it! He was poised incredibly somewhere in space, and he could see it all in a funny, blurry-double-sighted, dream-like way. He seemed to be seeing several pictures and hearing many voices, all at once. It was all mixed up, and yet it made a weird kind of sense. For a panicked instant he wanted to rip the helmet off his head. It's only an illusion, he told himself, forcing calm on his unwilling nerves. [SNIPPET] Again and again he fired, the butt jerking into the flesh of his shoulder, the smell of powder in his nostrils. It was no use. Too many of them. Lewis Stillman knew that he was going to die. The rifle was empty at last, the final bullet had been fired. He had no place to run because they were all around him, in a slowly closing circle."
2313,"""The Alamo, sir."" A slow, steady excitement seemed to burn in the Britainer's bright eyes. "" Santa Anna won't forget that name, you can be sure. You'll want to talk to the other officers now, sir? About the message we drew up for Sam Houston?"" [SNIPPET] In addition, Mike did not like the way the whole Branchell business was being handled. It seemed slipshod and hurried, and, worse, it was entirely too mysterious and melodramatic. “Of all the times to have to come to Antarctica,” he grumped as the door of the rocket opened, “why did I have to get July?” [56] The pilot, a young man in his early twenties, said smugly: “July is bad, but January isn’t good—just not so worse.” Mike the Angel glowered. “ Sonny, I was a cadet here when you were learning arithmetic."
2314,"“Busch majored in psychology at college, but took special courses after he graduated and took a Master’s in English. He has written two novels and three collections of poems under various pen names. At the time of Duvall’s death, he was working on the libretto of an opera. He has had no technical training, unless you want to count a year of high school [p 62] general science. So he wasn’t too much help in explaining how Duvall’s instrument works. “And, just to make matters more juicy, Duvall kept no notes. He had total recall and a childlike fear of putting anything into writing that had not been experimentally verified.” [SNIPPET] I was afraid to take a chance."" The Commissioner nodded. "" Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did. Freak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control."" He turned from the window. "" Well, Mr. Loyce."

Will you bring her home to the car—there is very little room here, as you know. [SNIPPET] ""What are you trying to do, anyhow?"" he demanded.  The Turks laughed and said something in their own language. They had no knowledge of English.  ""You're only making fools of yourselves,"" continued the boy, wrathfully. """
2316,"Since it was only five hundred and thirty-five dollars, Carrin signed for one, having it added to his son's debt. Right's right, he thought, walking Pathis to the door. This house will be Billy's some day. His and his wife's. They certainly will want everything up-to-date. [SNIPPET] Slow it as much as you can."" As surely as if he were sitting in its control room, Eddy slowed the ship, easing it down into the atmosphere. The instruments recorded the results of his playing upon the bank of controls, as sound pouring from a musical instrument. ""At the take-off point?"" Jennings asked. "" Can you land it there?"""
2317,"My companion gave a sigh of pleased surprise and enjoyment; nor did I wonder, for the garden between the wall and the house was redolent of the June flowers, and the roses were rolling over one another with that delicious superabundance of small well-tended gardens which at first sight takes away all thought from the beholder save that of beauty. The blackbirds were singing their loudest, the doves were cooing on the roof-ridge, the rooks in the high elm-trees beyond were garrulous among the young leaves, and the swifts wheeled whining about the gables. And the house itself was a fit guardian for all the beauty of this heart of summer. Once again Ellen echoed my thoughts as she said: “Yes, friend, this is what I came out for to see; this many-gabled old house built by the simple country-folk of the long-past times, regardless of all the turmoil that was going on in cities and courts, is lovely still amidst all the beauty which these latter days have created; and I do not wonder at our friends tending it carefully and making much of it. [SNIPPET] I looked daggers at Gowing, who replied: “I say, it’s no good trying to look indignant, with your hair full of parsley.” I rose from the table, and insisted that a stop should be put to this foolery at once. Frank Mutlar shouted: “Time, gentlemen, please! time!” and turned out the gas, leaving us in absolute darkness. I was feeling my way out of the room, when I suddenly received a hard intentional punch at the back of my head."
2318,"This snake was striped with blue and gold, and wore on his head a great cap of humming-birds' feathers. Manuel half drew his sword to attack this serpentine design, with which Miramon Lluagor made sleeping terrible for the red tribes that hunt and fish behind the Hesperides. But Manuel looked at Niafer. And Niafer displayed a drolly marked small turtle, saying, ""Maskanako, do you not recognize Tulapin, the turtle that never lies?"" The serpent howled, as though a thousand dogs had been kicked simultaneously, and the serpent fled. ""Why, snip, did he do that?"" asked Manuel, smiling sleepily and gravely, as for the third time he found that his charmed sword Flamberge was unneeded. [SNIPPET] Let me see; you have given me your promise that my confidence will be respected? That confidence, I may say, will be far from complete. But I am prepared to give you a few indications which will be of interest. In the first place, you are probably aware that two years ago I made a journey to South America—one which will be classical in the scientific history of the world? The object of my journey was to verify some conclusions of Wallace and of Bates, which could only be done by observing their reported facts under the same conditions in which they had themselves noted them. If my expedition had no other results it would still have been noteworthy, but a curious incident occurred to me while there which opened up an entirely fresh line of inquiry."

Dorothy's mouth hung open in surprise, and before she could recover enough to launch a fresh tirade Sam Meecham had walked out, slamming the door behind him. He paused in the cool evening and gazed upward. The government had gone only to the Moon. Sam Meecham was going to the stars! The next day he was given the silent treatment.

""As it was, they were able to keep themselves alive, and keep something like civilization going at the Fort, while the whole country was breaking apart around them.

2320,"It's over a mile yet, and a couple of more corners, before we get to the spot where I left it. Of course, it will be closer than that by now. It was spreading at perhaps a hundred yards an hour then. That's one figure we must refine.... Of course, I'll try to get samples, too. I wish there were some way to get samples of the central cone.

2321,"The fear of one who sees how his haste and breed can be called punishable criminal negligence, was in his face. The things that had been human, sprawled stiff before him, accusing him. But the worst was the presence of those grim, silent men, who might add him forcibly to the death-list. That moment held crystallized in it the conflict of an urge to win vast profits, with the payment in human lives that had been exacted this time. Near-dead Titan was the present step in mankind's outward march of colonial dominion toward the stars. [SNIPPET] They'll come out with the proof..."" Other voices were shouting.

2323,"said Gulchenrouz; “put thy hand upon my heart, for it feels as if it were frozen. Alas! thou art as cold as myself! Hath the Caliph murdered us both with his terrible look?” [SNIPPET] Aloft on the mountain glimmered the fronts of various royal mausoleums, the horror of which was deepened by the shadows of night. They passed through two villages almost deserted, the only inhabitants remaining being a few feeble old men, who, at the sight of horses and litters, fell upon their knees and cried out: “O Heaven! is it then by these phantoms that we have been for six months tormented? Alas! it was from the terror of these spectres and the noise beneath the mountains, that our people have fled, and left us at the mercy of maleficent spirits!”"

It was while he was listening to a film wire of Tyrsa's (the last she ever made, in the curious tonalities of that newly rediscovered Mozart opera) and seeing her homely face, made even less lovely by the effort of those effortless-sounding notes, that he became conscious of the operative phrase. ""If you loved me...."""
2325,"""But if it's just mud, it wouldn't hurt the ship, would it?"" ""Probably not."" ""Then why all this fuss about getting the tractors back in a hurry?"" The voice which answered reminded him of another lady in his past, who had kept him after school for drawing pictures in math class. [SNIPPET] If anything really drastic happened, the ship would be no protection. The sun, hanging just above the horizon slightly to the watcher's right, cast long shadows which made the cracks stand out clearly; as far as either man could see, nothing had changed recently. They descended the ladder carefully—even the best designed spacesuits are somewhat vulnerable—and made their way to the spot where the tractors were parked. A sheet-metal fence a dozen feet high and four times as long provided shade, which was more than a luxury this close to the sun. The tractors were parked in this shadow, and beside and between them were piles of equipment and specimens. The apparatus Schlossberg had devised was beside the tractor at the north end of the line, just inside the shaded area."
2326,"However, we were all on a better footing now; and I resolved for the future to avoid all dangerous topics, historical and geographical, and confine myself to subjects relating to the emotional side of our natures.  At the end our way to the house was over a green turf, among great trees as in a park; and as there was no road or path, the first sight of the building seen near, when we emerged from the trees, came as a surprise. There were no gardens, lawns, inclosures or hedges near it, nor cultivation of any kind. It was like a wilderness, and the house produced the effect of a noble ruin. It was a hilly stone country where masses of stone cropped out here and there among the woods and on the green slopes, and it appeared that the house had been raised on the natural foundation of one of these rocks standing a little above the river that flowed behind it. The stone was gray, tinged with red, and the whole rock, covering an acre or so of ground, had been worn or hewn down to form a vast platform which stood about a dozen feet above the surrounding green level. The sloping and buttressed sides of the platform were clothed with ivy, wild shrubs, and various flowering plants. [SNIPPET] Their garments were also made in a different fashion, and consisted of a kilt-like dress, which came half-way to the knees, a pale yellow shirt fitting tight to the skin, and over it a loose sleeveless vest. The entire legs were cased in stockings, curious in pattern and color. The women wore garments resembling those of the men, but the tight-fitting sleeves reached only half-way to the elbow, the rest of the arm being bare; and the outergarment was all in one piece, resembling a long sleeveless jacket, reaching below the hips. The color of their dresses varied, but in most cases different shades of blue and subdued yellow predominated. In all, the stockings showed deeper and richer shades of color than the other garments; and in their curiously segmented appearance, and in the harmonious arrangement of the tints, they seemed to represent the skins of pythons and other beautifully variegated serpents. All wore low shoes of an orange-brown color, fitting closely so as to display the shape of the foot.  From the moment of first seeing them I had had no doubt about the sex of the tall old leader of the procession, his shining white beard being as conspicuous at a distance as a shield or a banner; but looking at the others I was at first puzzled to know whether the party was composed of men or women, or of both, so much did they resemble each other in height, in their smooth faces, and in the length of their hair."
2327,"How do you get all this information, Ord? You recite it like you had read it all some place—like it were history."" Ord merely smiled. "" Oh, I don't know everything, colonel. That is why I had to come here. There is so much we don't know about what happened.... I mean, sir, what will happen—in the Alamo."" His sharp eyes grew puzzled for an instant. "" [SNIPPET] The creature uttered a loud cry, and scrambled to its feet. He raised one hand, attempting a friendly gesture; but the creature, after watching him for a moment with wide eyes, bounded swiftly away into the woods. He heard the thumping and crashing of its passage through the underbrush long after it had disappeared from sight. His first sensation was one of immense relief. He had been desperately afraid. Evidently the thing had been afraid of him, too. And that was surprising.... Clearly, these could not be the reasoning things that had built the flying machine he had seen."
2328,"""Ideal departure time is three hundred ten hours away, as you all know. We can stay here until then, or go into a parking-and-survey orbit at almost any time before then. You have all the survey you need, I should think, from the other time. But suit yourselves."" ""I'd just as soon be space-sick as seasick,"" remarked Camille Burkett. "" I still hate to think that the entire planet is as shivery as the spot we picked."" Willard Rowson smiled. "" [SNIPPET] ""Come on, Arnie!

2329,"A commission was appointed, but the eleven only cried for their mothers and would not confess. Then they were shut up, each by herself, in the dark, and put on black bread and water for ten days and nights; and by that time they were haggard and wild, and their eyes were dry and they did not cry any more, but only sat and mumbled, and would not take the food. Then one of them confessed, and said they had often ridden through the air on broomsticks to the witches' Sabbath, and in a bleak place high up in the mountains had danced and drunk and caroused with several hundred other witches and the Evil One, and all had conducted themselves in a scandalous way and had reviled the priests and blasphemed God. That is what she said—not in narrative form, for she was not able to remember any of the details without having them called to her mind one after the other; but the commission did that, for they knew just what questions to ask, they being all written down for the use of witch-commissioners two centuries before. They asked, “Did you do so and so?” [SNIPPET] The man must be either an escaped lunatic or has tried his hand at a hoax. It is a tissue of absurdity."" He spoke bluntly, almost harshly, because he was in terror at the thought that she might be allowing herself to be deluded by this wild and baseless fancy, but he looked away as he spoke. He could not bear to see the effect of his words. ""It is not absurd,"" she cried, clasping his arm convulsively with both hands so that she hurt him, and looking fiercely at him out of hot, fevered eyes. "" It is the most reasonable thing in the world. It must be true."
2330,"When Sir Tristram heard that, he was soon armed and on his horse, and Governale, his servant, followed him with shield and spear.  And as he rode, he met his cousin Sir Andret, who had been commanded by King Mark to bring home to him two knights of King Arthur’s court who roamed the country thereabouts seeking adventures.  “What tidings?” said Sir Tristram.  “God help me, never worse,” replied his cousin; “for those I went to bring have beaten and defeated me, and set my message at naught.” [SNIPPET] “It were shame,” said Lancelot, “for an armed to slay an unarmed man.”  “Thou hast no other favour from me,” said Sir Phelot.  “Alas!” cried Sir Lancelot, “that ever any knight should die weaponless!”"
2331,"The similarity of pattern in the wing and leg of a bat, though used for such different purpose,—in the jaws and legs of a crab,—in the petals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, is likewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were alike in the early progenitor of each class. On the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life, we can clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should be so closely alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms. We may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those in a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water, by the aid of well-developed branchiæ. Disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce an organ, when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed conditions [480]of life; and we can clearly understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs. But disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for existence, and will thus have little power of acting on an organ during early life; hence the organ will not be much reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. The calf, for instance, has inherited teeth, which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early progenitor having well-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature animal were reduced, during successive generations, by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been better fitted by natural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a remote period to the present day. On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! [SNIPPET] In the mean time, while we descanted on alien sorrows, and on a solitude which struck our eyes and not our hearts, while we imagined all of change and suffering that had intervened in these once thronged streets, before, tenantless and abandoned, they became mere kennels for dogs, and stables for cattle:—while we read the death of the world upon the dark fane, and hugged ourselves in the remembrance that we possessed that which was all the world to us—in the m  We had arrived from Windsor early in October, and had now been in London about six weeks. Day by day, during that time, the health of my Idris declined: her heart was broken; neither sleep nor appetite, the chosen servants of health, waited on her wasted form. To watch her children hour by hour, to sit by me, drinking deep the dear persuasion that I remained to her, was all her pastime. Her vivacity, so long assumed, her affectionate display of cheerfulness, her light-hearted tone and springy gait were gone. I could not disguise to myself, nor could she conceal, her life-consuming sorrow."
2332,"A silence fell upon us, both dreading to put into words the thoughts we knew must be spoken. Then, as our hearts beat audibly in the sacred stillness of night that had fallen about us, Zarlah murmured, clinging to me in despair, ""Oh, Harold, my love, how can we bear the agony of being parted!"" ""I would give my life to remain with you, dearest!"" I answered, pressing her passionately to me, but in a more soothing tone I added, ""We must be brave, love, it is but for a day—to-morrow I shall return, but before my departure from Earth I will speak with Almos, and tell him that I wish to abandon my body forever and to abide in spirit on Mars. [SNIPPET] I uncovered the instrument, and got everything into readiness, being careful to see that the batteries were all in place, so that nothing might occur to interrupt the long talk with the Martian which I was anticipating. Having turned on the current, and opened the sliding section of the glass roof, I now awaited the appearance of Mars. There occurred to me question alter question that seemed of sufficient importance to prompt immediate inquiry, only to be forgotten as others came into my mind; until the presence of the increasing faint glow on my instrument found me unprepared with any single question of actual importance. Consequently I decided to allow my distant informant to continue with the account of Martian observations of Earth, as being at once the most instructive and surest way of suggesting important questions."
2333,"Tiny, inhumanly capable hands clutched at him and the sun was hot above. There was a background sound of hydrogen bombs, heard mutely. He looked down at the hands that touched and asked something of his own. The eyes were not milky now. They stared up at him, alert and questioning. [SNIPPET] Gently he tried to pry their resisting hands away from hers. The hands fought back with a terrible strength beyond normality. By sheer greater force he tore one of the twins away. It was like releasing a bomb. Sudden pain stabbed through his body."
2334,"He put a slight emphasis on the last word, unconsciously perhaps. “Well, at least this will not reflect on the university. That is why I formed Psychonics as a separate business enterprise.” Then he added, with a grin, “The money was, of course, only a secondary consideration.” The president managed a smile. “ Of course.” “I suppose the Acquatainians want to see me?” [SNIPPET] No, of course not. You're not on the General Staff, so it shouldn't ... it won't ... affect you the way it did the others. Their reaction had nothing to do with the computer per se ..."" ""Several civilians have used the computer with no ill effects,"" General LeRoy said. "" Ford has used it many times."""
2335,"My friend spoke of my backslidings with concern; requesting me to make sure of my forgiveness, and to forsake them; and then he added some words of sweet comfort. But from this time forth I began to be sick at times of my existence. I had heart-burnings, longings, and, yearnings that would not be satisfied; and I seemed hardly to be an accountable creature; being thus in the habit of executing transactions of the utmost moment without being sensible that I did them. I was a being incomprehensible to myself. [SNIPPET] ""How long is it since Mrs. Calvert and you became acquainted?""  ""About a year and a half.""

2336,"She has come to stay with me.” ( The Duke glanced quickly round the room.) “ I cannot think why she is not down yet.” ( The Oriel don fixed his eyes on the clock, as though he suspected it of being fast.) “ I must ask you to forgive her. She appears to be a bright, pleasant young woman.” [SNIPPET] At first they went so fast that they could scarcely catch their breaths, but presently Quox slowed up and said with a sort of cackling laugh:  ""My scales! but that is some tumble. I think I shall take it easy and fall slower, or I'm likely to get dizzy. Is it very far to the other side of the world?""  ""Haven't you ever been through this Tube before?"""
2337,"Through the storm the plane raced. Suddenly the motor died with sickening suddenness. ""Our haywire battery connections are gone,"" shouted McCready. "" Say your prayers."" The wind tossed the plane about like a feather. Rapidly it lost altitude. A building loomed up before them. [SNIPPET] A hasty examination of my instrument assured me that all was in order, and, turning on the current, I now watched the surface of wires for the glow that would signalize the commencement of wave contact. Should this glow appear without an image of any kind it would have but one meaning—that the mechanism of the virator had failed to do its work the night previous, and that disaster had befallen Almos. My heart beat fast, therefore, when in a short time a faint glow appeared on the upper portion of my instrument and rapidly spread until it covered the entire surface. As it grew brighter I was obliged to turn away, before I could recognize any image, and, as I stood shielding my eyes from the strong glare, I felt my heart sink within me. But, before I could approach the instrument again, I heard my name called in the clear, ringing tones of Almos' beloved voice."
2338,"Presently he condescended to say something more. Pointing to the marks or characters which I could not read, he said: ""You have seen the name of Yoletta here, and that and the resemblance misled you. You must know that there has always been a Yoletta in this house. This was the daughter of Mistrelde, the Mother, who died young and left but eight children; and when this work was made their portraits were placed on the eight faces of the pedestal.""  ""Thanks for telling me,"" I said, wondering if it was all true, or only a fantastic romance.  He then motioned me to follow him, and we quitted that room where it had been decided that we were not to sup. [SNIPPET] ""My son, I am glad to hear these words,"" he answered, somewhat to my surprise, for I had greatly feared that I had adopted too bold a course. "" For I see now,"" he continued, ""that this seeming indifference, which gave me some pain, does not proceed from an incapacity on your part to feel as we do, but from a tender love and compassion—that most precious of all our emotions, which will serve to draw you closer to us. I have also thought much of Yoletta during these beautiful days, grieving for her, and this morning I have allowed her to go out into the hills, so that during this day, at least, she will be able to share in our pleasure.""  Scarcely waiting for another word to be spoken, I flew back to the house, anxious enough for a ride now."
2339,"He smiled vaguely into the rumbling night. That’s what it was. Odd that he should have forgotten. How many rocket pilots, he wondered, were weaned on Burroughs’ books? And how many remembered now that the Thern priests all wore yellow wings and a circlet of gold with some fantastic jewel on their forehead? [SNIPPET] ""It is true that the robots of your Terran Empire and these simple workers here must obey orders. But they are subject to a higher law, and you have forced them to break it. That is your crime."" ""What crime?"""
2340,"Its causes, sorrow, jealousy, envy, hatred, and discontent, are eliminated, and a normal condition of perfect immunity from wrong-doing and unhappiness exists. ""It has been discovered on Earth that crime is the result of a diseased brain, and with us this discovery, in time, developed the fact that wrong-doing, even in its minor phases, is the result of physical ill health. Maintain, then, a perfect state of bodily health in a community, and there is no wrong-doing and consequent unhappiness. ""The means of obtaining this bodily health was discovered on Mars, in the form of invisible light rays, almost six hundred years ago, and its discovery led to a complete transformation in social conditions, establishing perfect tranquillity and happiness upon the entire globe. [SNIPPET] Passing through the small chamber and down the narrow passage, it reaches the body, and immediately changes to a return flow. This current is but momentary; the patient is seen to move, and the body is once more quickened by the life spark. The flow of super-radium has conveyed the spirit of the patient from the small chamber above and released it in the body as it returned, in exactly the same manner as it does with light-waves or sound-waves."" ""Marvelous!"""
2341,"He shrugged his shoulders, an indication to them of his helplessness. ""You're not going to like this,[105] Jim,"" the general was saying. "" But it's orders from Pentagon. Are you familiar with Senator O'Noonan?"" ""Vaguely,"" Jennings answered. ""You'll be more familiar with him, Jim. [SNIPPET] ""But, Jeff, you can't sign a release."" Jeff stared at her in the silent room. "" Why not? If it's the only thing I can do—"""
2342,"Two days to go. At first being on Mass-Time makes everything seem normal again. By sleep time there is a strain, and next day it is everywhere. I know as well as any that on Mass-Time the greater the mass the faster the shift; all the same I cannot help feeling we are being slowed, dragged back by the dead ship coupled to our live one. [SNIPPET] Expressionless, he looked down, without psychological advantage, at the seated civilian holding the partially smoked cigar. Later the same day, Mr. Tucker and two of the three other members of the Committee donned surface suits and, together with Captain Meford, the cartographer assigned to Miracastle, they boarded the surface scout. They arranged themselves in the uncomfortable bucket seats and strapped in. ""Little early for an easy ride,"" Mr. Tucker commented. ""I've been out before,"" Captain Meford said laconically."
2343,"Something would have passed, in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one of us would have moved. The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make me doubt if even I were in life. I can’t express what followed it save by saying that the silence itself—which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my strength—became the element into which I saw the figure disappear; in which I definitely saw it turn as I might have seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was lost.    I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there by the light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora’s little bed was empty; and on this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before, I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had left her lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering sound: I perceived an agitation of the window blind, and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other side of it. [SNIPPET] I fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmering taper there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow. “ What do you mean by all the rest?”  “Oh, you know, you know!”  I could say nothing for a minute, though I felt, as I held his hand and our eyes continued to meet, that my silence had all the air of admitting his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was perhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. “ Certainly you shall go back to school,” I said, “if it be that that troubles you. But not to the old place—we must find another, a better."
2344,"He took Wehling's pistol, really intending to shoot himself. But he didn't have the nerve. And then he saw the telephone booth in the corner of the room. He went to it, dialed the well-remembered number: ""2 B R 0 2 B."" ""Federal Bureau of Termination,"" said the very warm voice of a hostess. ""How soon could I get an appointment?"" he asked, speaking very carefully. [SNIPPET] A vase shattered against the wall, inches above his head. In the next moment, a free-for-all was under way, with each couple battling to eject every other couple from the room. Fighting coalitions formed and dissolved with the lightning changes of the tactical situation. Em and Lou were thrown into the hall, where they organized others in the same situation, and stormed back into the room. After two hours of struggle, with nothing like a decision in sight, the cops broke in, followed by television cameramen from mobile units. For the next half-hour, patrol wagons and ambulances hauled away Fords, and then the apartment was still and spacious. An hour later, films of the last stages of the riot were being televised to 500,000,000 delighted viewers on the Eastern Seaboard."
2345,"It was low and far off, but I knew instantly what it was, and felt a choking sensation of fear and horror, as if an icy hand had gripped my throat, on recognising the air of the Gagliarda. It was being played on the violin, and a long way off, but I knew that tune too well to permit of my having any doubt on the subject.  Any trouble or fear becomes, as you will some day learn, my dear nephew, immensely intensified and exaggerated at night. It is so, I suppose, because our nerves are in an excited condition, and our brain not sufficiently awake to give a due account of our foolish imaginations. I have myself many times lain awake wrestling in thought with difficulties which in the hours of darkness seemed insurmountable, but with the dawn resolved themselves into merely trivial inconveniences. [SNIPPET] The Zodiacal Light seems never to have attracted from astronomers in general the amount of careful attention that it deserves; perhaps because so little can really be made of it as far as explanation is concerned. I have referred to the restraint that scientific writers apparently feel in speaking of it. The grounds for speculation that it affords may be too scanty to lead to long discussions, yet it piques curiosity, and as we shall see in a moment has finally led to a most interesting theory. Once it was the subject of an elaborate series of studies which carried the observer all round the world."
2346,"No. He didn't get violent."" Hanstark wrote as he asked the next question. "" Just what was his reaction?"" ""He said I must be crazy."" ""Were those his exact words?"" [SNIPPET] I'd say you'd been chewin' some loco weed."" ""And if I could prove it?"" Nest answered after a moment's pause. "" Why then, I guess I'd be loco."" Hanstark thought it was going to be easy. """
2347,"Nevertheless, when I was at last conducted to his quarters at the end of one of the tunnels—my long awaited visit—I did not spend all my time complimenting him for his fine achievements. ""You're going to be ready to make the trip with the tribe, I presume?"" I asked, when we got around to the plans for the migration. ""And leave the ship here? I shall follow orders, Captain, but I should prefer to stay with the ship, and to proceed with the remainder of the scientific assignments."" [SNIPPET] That was when I had nicknamed him ""Split""—and the wide ears that stuck out from his stubble-cut blond hair had glowed with the pink of selfconsciousness. Plainly, he liked the kidding. But if I thought I could rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken. Now he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused."
2348,"And I was good until they . They had hounded him back to the land when he quit. Others had not been so lucky. When a whole people panic then an object for their hate must be found. A naming. An immediate object. He remembered the newspaper story that began: ""They lynched twelve men, twelve ex-men, in New Mexico last night ..."" [SNIPPET] And you could not know for your mind was hiding and alone. I have seen ..."" He cried out and pulled his hands away. Sound died, the room was normal again. The milky, white eyes surveyed him, the hands remained locked securely over those of the mother. The thin carven features of the children were emotionless, waiting. He strove for rational meaning within his brain."
2349,"“Be that as it may,” continued Garvers, “it was the only explanation I had at the time. Either someone was watching me, which seemed impossible, or I was beginning to crack under the strain. “Well, I put my papers away and [p 61] tried to take a short break. I was reaching into my drawer where I keep magazines when, so help me, a man stepped out of the wall into my office.” “What? It seems as if you just said a guy stepped out of the wall.” [SNIPPET] All around him were the greens of the grasses and leaves and the yellows and blues of the field flowers. It was warm, a spring day, with none of the discomfort of summer heat. Jubilant, Roger spun around in circles, inhaling the fragrance of the field, listening to the hum of insect life stirring back to awareness after a season of inactivity. Then he was running and tumbling, barefoot, his shirt open, feeling the soft grass give way underfoot and the soil was good and rich beneath him. He saw a stream ahead, with clear water melodiously flowing by him. He went to it and drank, the cold, good water quenching all his thirst, clearing all the stickiness of his throat and mind. He dashed the water on his face and was happy and felt the coolness of it as the breeze picked up and swept his hair over his forehead."
2350,"""I want you to give the order to your leaders. There are a hundred of them, perhaps a few more. No doubt my list is not absolutely accurate. Call them in, from Chicago, St. Louis, New Orleans, Boston and Philadelphia. Have them all in one room. [SNIPPET] ""No! All on my list or none."" ""Your list?"" ""Certainly! I am not sure that it is absolutely correct, but it satisfies me."" ""Let me see it."" ""No reason why you should not."""
2351,"He spake so cheerfully that Richard looked at him askance, wondering what was toward with him, and if mayhappen anything lay underneath those words of his.  But in his heart Ralph was thinking of that last tale of the woman whom the young man had met such a little while ago; and it seemed to him that she must have been in Whitwall when he first came there; and he scarce knew whether he were sorry or not that he had missed her: for though it seemed to him that it would be little more than mere grief and pain, nay, that it would be wicked and evil to be led to the Well at the World's End by any other than her who was to have brought him there; yet he longed, or thought he longed to speak with her concerning that love of his heart, so early rewarded, so speedily beggared. For indeed he doubted not that the said woman was the damsel of Bourton Abbas, whose image had named herself Dorothea to him in that dream. [SNIPPET] This was the money Sergey Ivanovitch had paid.) Then he remembered how he had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street. He remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother Sergey Ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share of his mother’s fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder.... It was all horribly disgusting, yet to Levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay, did not know all his story, did not know his heart.  Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the period of fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone, far from encouraging him, had jeered at him, and he, too, with the others. They had teased him, called him Noah, and monk; and, when he had broken out, no one had helped him, but everyone had turned away from him with horror and disgust.  Levin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his life, his brother Nikolay, in his soul, in the very depths of his soul, was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him. He was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence."
2352,"""Heavens!"" sighed Bella. "" Don't be prehistoric, Sam. There hasn't been anything really criminal for twenty years now. This is 1975 you know."" [SNIPPET] ""I've found you! I've found you!"" he cried. "" Oh, Ellen, if only you knew how lonely it has been—"" He opened his glad heart to her in a stammering urgency, bliss in his eyes, tears in his voice."
2353,"I entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their own, and that they were entrusted with the voyage, in some measure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for want of their help, and that they could not answer for it to God or man. But I might as well have talked to the mainmast of the ship: they were mad upon their journey; only they gave me good words, and begged I would not be angry; that they did not doubt but they would be back again in about an hour at furthest; for the Indian town, they said, was not above half-a mile off, though they found it above two miles before they got to it. Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them their due, they went about it as warily as boldly; they were gallantly armed, for they had every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol; some of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boatswain and two more had poleaxes; besides all which they had among them thirteen hand grenadoes. Bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked work in the world. When they went out their chief design was plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them all. [SNIPPET] “Well, Friday,” says I, “do you think we shall find anybody here or no? and do you think we shall see your father?” The fellow stood mute as a stock a good while; but when I named his father, the poor affectionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his face very plentifully. “ What is the matter, Friday? are you troubled because you may see your father?” “ No, no,” says he, shaking his head, “no see him more: no, never more see him again.” “ Why so, Friday?"
2354,"I'm afraid my ancestor wouldn't understand."" Travis shrugged. Who was he to say that Ord was crazy? In this day and age, any man with vision was looked on as mad. Sometimes he felt closer to Ord than to the others. [SNIPPET] There were no tools aboard capable of cutting through the hard shielding. He couldn't use it to shield the engine on the lifeboat. And the shielding that been on the other five engines had melted and run; it was worthless. Then another idea hit him."
2355,"All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the polarizer will polarize it."" ""That's just supposition,"" Junior said stubbornly. "" The fact is, it isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D."" ""Maybe the polarizer is broken,"" Fred suggested. Grampa snorted. "" Broken-shmoken. [SNIPPET] ""If we don't win the furlined teacup...."" Ives laughed. Johnny hauled on the wheel.[Pg 18] It wouldn't budge. ""Here—"" Ives began to approach. ""Get away,"" said Johnny."
2356,"""Can't deny that,"" he said, watching the branches of the Untouchable Bush draw away as they walked through it. ""Now,"" he said, when he was stretched out on the undulant moss. He felt at the patch of moss sprouting under the warmth of his palm, and watched while an exploratory tendril curled around his little finger. "" Now—do you know what it is I want of you?"" [SNIPPET] He waggled them in what might have been a gesture of delight or greeting; it was hard to say which. His expression was one of pleasure. He stood at Regan's side and smiled at him. His hands felt over the headpiece of the spacesuit, then went thumping down the rest of it. ""I'll be out of the damn thing soon,"" Regan thought."
2357,"said he, with a sigh and melancholy look. "" It is decreed in the councils above that they must both fall by your hand.""  ""The God of Heaven forbid it!"" said I. ""They are enemies to Christ and His Church, that I know and believe; but they shall live and die in their iniquity for me, and reap their guerdon when their time cometh. There my hand shall not strike.""  ""The feeling is natural, and amiable,"" said he. "" But you must think again. [SNIPPET] The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;—and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before. After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation. She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.—Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object. She could think only of her letter."
2358,"Would they lock him up? What would happen to his cars? And his business? ""How did you ... no! Wait a minute. Don't say a word. [SNIPPET] The metal-collared leader of the pack that had captured Powell presented the rat-king with the captive’s gun-belt and two Silver Belts, accompanying the gifts with a squealing oration that was apparently a recital of the capture. The old monarch took the trophies with delight. The two Silver Belts were promptly draped over his own furry shoulders by the king—seemingly following the same primitive love for adornment that inspires an African savage to ornament his person with any new and glittering object he happens to acquire. The rat-king then graciously draped the cartridge-belt and holstered automatics around the shoulders of the metal-collared leader who had captured Powell."
2359,"George, being thus adjured, picked up the topmost sheet; for they were, as I heard him explain to the bo'sun, all oddly numbered, and having but little reference one to the other. Yet we were mightily keen to know even so much as such odd scraps might tell unto us. Whereupon, George read from the next wrapper, which ran thus:— ""Now, suddenly, I heard the Captain cry out that there was something in the main cabin, and immediately my lover's voice calling to me to lock my door, and on no condition to open it. Then the door of the Captain's cabin slammed, and there came a silence, and the silence was broken by a sound. Now, this was the first time that I had heard the Thing make search through the big cabin; but, afterwards, my lover told me it had happened aforetime, and they had told me naught, fearing to frighten me needlessly; though now I understood why my lover had bidden me never to leave my stateroom door unbolted in the nighttime. I remember also, wondering if the noise of breaking glass that had waked me somewhat from my dreams a night or two previously, had been the work of this indescribable Thing; for on the morning following that night, the glass in the skylight had been smashed. [SNIPPET] But why do you make this unprovoked attack on me, Digrung?”  “I don’t attack you, woman, but I know you. I see into you, and I see insanity. That wouldn’t matter, but I don’t like to see a man of intelligence like Maskull caught in your filthy meshes.”  “I suppose even you clever Matterplay people sometimes misjudge character. However, I don’t mind."
2360,"A moment's consciousness of being drawn gently to the floor of the car again, while the furniture and other articles that had been drifting about piled lightly upon me without any perceptible weight; a slight shock, then, as the suffocating sensation became more intense, a blackness rushed in upon me, and my senses reeled—   A tall, gaunt figure, swathed in black robes, Stood waiting some distance from me. I knew that it was Death, for under the hood I beheld the grinning skull with its sightless eye-holes, and I turned away in loathsome dread. [SNIPPET] They were just a trifle too far away for her to see them distinctly in the waning light of the dying day, but she knew that they were too large, they were out of proportion to the perfectly proportioned bodies, and they were oblate in form. She could see that the men wore some manner of harness to which were slung the customary long-sword and short-sword of the Barsoomian warrior, and that about their short necks were massive leather collars cut to fit closely over the shoulders and snugly to the lower part of the head. Their features were scarce discernible, but there was a suggestion of grotesqueness about them that carried to her a feeling of revulsion.  The two carried a long rope to which were fastened, at intervals of about two sofads, what she later guessed were light manacles, for she saw the warriors passing among the poor creatures in the enclosure and about the right wrist of each they fastened one of the manacles. When all had been thus fastened to the rope one of the warriors commenced to pull and tug at the loose end as though attempting to drag the headless company toward the tower, while the other went among them with a long, light whip with which he flicked them upon the naked skin. Slowly, dully, the creatures rose to their feet and between the tugging of the warrior in front and the lashing of him behind the hopeless band was finally herded within the tower."
2361,"Again, the camera receded and a man appeared in the foreground. For a moment he sat at his plain desk, gazing directly out of the screen and seeming to look searchingly into Don's face. Then he smiled engagingly and nodded.  ""As every citizen of Oredan knows,"" he said, ""this nation has been swept by a wave of terrorism during the few days past. Indeed, the now notorious Waern affair became so serious that our Prime Minister found it necessary to take personal command of the Enforcement Corps and direct the search for the terrorists himself. Now, he is present, to bring to you, the people, his report of the conclusion of this terrible affair."" He paused, drawing a breath. [SNIPPET] What's gotten into you, Lyddy? In the old days, you used to be so calm."" She wriggled her shoulders uncomfortably. "" I keep seeing things, shadows that shouldn't be there, reflections of nothing. Only, when I turn, they don't get out of the way fast enough to be nothing."" ""They?"""
2362,"Rene spat the sentence out onto the ground. "" But if you think I'm going to do any more looking, take another guess."" He tramped back into his own ship, leaving the outside port and the pressure chamber open. If only Uncle Izzy had done that! [SNIPPET] Or, being able to crush it, if he would take care not to. ""Oh—trade agreements, immigration agreements, how many space ships can go where—who can say what either side did when or where to begin it all? Nobody is making it happen. Sometimes, perhaps. But not as far as this war is concerned."
2363,"Too much had become possible. Sometimes it might be a land too strange for human wits. Maybe primitive terror prompted Les to sudden violence. Or it was the sickening cynicism in Loman's words. [SNIPPET] The commander wiped at his swollen lips, wincing, and an almost child-like petulance came into his tone. "" You weren't supposed to survive."" ""I know,"" he said again. "" We've made it a point to remember that."""
2364,"""And make the best of what we've got,"" Reba went on, unheeding. "" If we look at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world. Earth gravity. The flivver—even if the polarizer won't work, there's the resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By then, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here we won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we want."" [SNIPPET] It had a built-in atomic battery which would require renovation no oftener than every twenty years. Voluntary control was provided through connection with certain muscles in my neck, and I soon learned to operate it at least as efficiently as a normal heart with the normal involuntary controls. The mechanism was considerably bigger than the natural organ, but the salvage operation was a complete success. The bulge between my shoulder blades for the battery and the one in front of my chest for the pump were not excessively unsightly."
2365,"Guldran's pulse leaped. He yelled again, ""Food!"" The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. [SNIPPET] Jon Karyl asked. The answer was almost caressing: ""It is a liquid we use to dissolve metals. It causes joints to harden if even so much as a drop remains on it long. It eats away the metal, leaving a scaly residue which crumbles eventually into dust. ""We will dilute it with a harmless liquid for you since No. 1 does not wish you to die instantly. ""Enter your""—the Steel-Blue hesitated—""mausoleum."
2366,"“It couldn’t have been sounder. We had to keep to our schedule even if it killed us, because it would positively kill us if we didn’t.” “But a man like that—” “A man like McIvers was necessary. Can’t you see that? It was the Sun that beat us, that surface. Perhaps we were licked the very day we started.” [SNIPPET] I have a couple of instruments still monitoring the sun just in case, but everything in the revised program is on tape."" ""Good. Tom, any use asking you?"" The biologist grimaced. "" I've been shown two hundred and sixteen different samples of rock and dust. I have examined in detail twelve crystal growths which looked vaguely like vegetation."
2367,"I am a prince of the royal blood, and unless you treat me respectfully I shall have my father, the King, march his army on you and destroy your whole country. """"He barks louder,"" said the soldier. "" Look out for him; he may be dangerous."" The next moment he threw the rope and caught poor Zingle around his arms and body, so that he was helpless. Then the soldier-monkey pulled hard on the rope, and Prince Zingle fell out of the tree to the ground. At first the monkeys all pressed backward, as if frightened, but their soldiers cried out:""We've got him; he can't bite now. [SNIPPET] Far before him loomed the mountains toward which the green man had been fleeing when last he had seen him, and with dogged resolution the son of John Carter, endowed with the indomitable will of his mighty sire, took up the pursuit on foot.  All that night he forged ahead until, with the dawning of a new day, he entered the low foothills that guard the approach to the fastness of the mountains of Torquas.  Rugged, granitic walls towered before him. Nowhere could he discern an opening through the formidable barrier; yet somewhere into this inhospitable world of stone the green warrior had borne the woman of the red man’s heart’s desire.  Across the yielding moss of the sea-bottom there had been no spoor to follow, for the soft pads of the thoat but pressed down in his swift passage the resilient vegetation which sprang up again behind his fleeting feet, leaving no sign.  But here in the hills, where loose rock occasionally strewed the way; where black loam and wild flowers partially replaced the sombre monotony of the waste places of the lowlands, Carthoris hoped to find some sign that would lead him in the right direction.  Yet, search as he would, the baffling mystery of the trail seemed likely to remain for ever unsolved."
2368,"From the arched, exquisite throat pealed a trumpet call—golden, summoning, imperious. Thrice it rang forth—and all the surrounding valley seemed to halt and listen.  Followed upon its ending, a chanting as goldenly sonorous. Wild, peremptory, triumphant. It was like a mustering shouting to adventurous stars, buglings to buccaneering winds, cadenced beckonings to restless ranks of viking waves, signaling to all the corsairs and picaroons of the elemental.  A cosmic call to slay!  The gigantic block upon which we rode quivered; I myself felt a thousand needle-pointed roving arrows prick me, urging me on to some jubilant, reckless orgy of destruction. [SNIPPET] When the dregs of Europe come over to my city and use the rats of Asia to bleed that city white, then I personally protest. I am going to start something. I am not sure what, but when I finish, this city will be practically rat empty and gangster free."" ""A large programme, Mr. Willowby,"" whispered Perkins. ""But I am a large man."
2369,"Presently he raised his long arm, as Edmund had done, and pointed upward. A momentary chill of disappointment ran through me—could he do no more than that? But he did more. Half unconsciously I had stepped forward where I could see his face. His eyes were speaking. I knew it. [SNIPPET] He hoards the treasures of his heart for its coming mistress. Of her alone he thinks, and to her all his vows are made. The thought of license would be treasop to his sovereign lady, whose right to all the revenues of his being he joyfully owns. To rob her, to abate her high prerogatives, would be to impoverish, to insult, himself; for she is to be his, and her honor, her glory, are his own."
2370,"Mattern cried. The kqyres was his tower of strength; he would not conceive of any weakness in him. It would mean that he would be forced to rely upon himself. And yet, he thought, I am certainly old and experienced enough by now to begin relying upon myself. In fact, I'm getting a little old and tired, too. ""You know,"" he said to his partner, ""maybe we both ought to retire."" ""What do you mean?"" [SNIPPET] Floating shadows merely hinted at the lofty ceiling, and gloom that lent itself to illusion lurked in the corners. There seemed to be neither windows nor doors in the walls, or else they were concealed by the nighted tapestries. Where the dim light came from, Yasmina could not determine. The great room was a realm of mysteries, or shadows, and shadowy shapes in which she could not have sworn to observe movement, yet which invaded her mind with a dim and formless terror. But her gaze fixed itself on a tangible object."
2371,"Why didst thou not keep a still tongue in thy head and let his patron saint look after the welfare of this princeling? Your rashness has brought you to a pretty pass, for it must be either you or I, My Lady, and it cannot be I. Say thy prayers and compose thyself for death.”  Henry III, King of England, sat in his council chamber surrounded by the great lords and nobles who composed his suit. He awaited Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, whom he had summoned that he might heap still further indignities upon him with the intention of degrading and humiliating him that he might leave England forever. The King feared this mighty kinsman who so boldly advised him against the weak follies which were bringing his kingdom to a condition of revolution.  What the outcome of this audience would have been none may say, for Leicester had but just entered and saluted his sovereign when there came an interruption which drowned the petty wrangles of king and courtier in a common affliction that touched the hearts of all. [SNIPPET] ""What does it say?"" she asked the yellow hen, who trotted along beside her in a rather dignified fashion.  ""How should I know?"" returned the hen. "" I cannot read."""
2372,"Do see those fine, young fellows yonder! ' Tis, I declare, a great disgrace; When they might have the very best, I wonder, After these galls they needs must race! Second scholar [to the first]. Stop! [SNIPPET] I like at times to exchange with him a word, And take care not to break with him. ' Tis civil In the old fellow[4] and so great a Lord To talk so kindly with the very devil.  Night. In a narrow high-arched Gothic room, FAUST sitting uneasy at his desk. Faust. Have now, alas!"
2373,"We shall get more time."" ""Humph! prolonging the agony, that's all. I begin to wish it was all over."" Gazen directed his instrument on the planet, and we resumed our observations. ""We are no longer rising,"" said Gazen after a time. "" [SNIPPET] There was something about Monty's greeting, cordial as it was, that gave the older man a hint as to the situation.  ""Won't you stop for dinner, Monty?"" he asked, in the hope that his suspicion was groundless.  ""Thank you, Colonel, not to-night,"" and he was off before the Colonel could hold him."
2374,"For that matter, how long will we last...? Mex, did you toss Tiflin back his shiv?"" ""A couple of hours ago,"" Ramos answered mildly. Everybody was looking down at the Moon, whose crater-pocked ugliness and beauty was sparsely dotted with the blue spots of stellene domes, many of them housing embryo enterprises that were trying to beat the blastoff cost of necessities brought from Earth, and to supply spacemen and colonists with their needs, cheaply. The nine fragile rings were soon in orbit. [SNIPPET] Something was very wrong. Had Costa walked into a trap—or tripped an alarm? It didn't really matter which, either way the balloon had gone up. Neel walked on slowly, painfully aware of his own inadequacy in dealing with the situation."
2375,"It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but—the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand. [SNIPPET] said the mother. “ Tell me the way, and I shall find him!”  “I know it!” said the woman in the black clothes. “ But before I tell it, thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child! I am fond of them."
2376,"""I'll take that chance,"" he replied.  She was conscious of disappointment after he was gone. He had not pleaded as ardently as she had expected and desired, and, try as she would, she could not banish the touch of irritation that had come to haunt her for the night.  Brewster walked to the club, elated that he had at least made a beginning. His position was now clear. Besides losing a fortune he must win Barbara in open competition. [SNIPPET] I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could."
2377,"I have covered half the distance. Twenty feet from him, and he takes a quick step back. Turn, kick, out, step. I am swinging round away from him, let's hope he finds it reassuring. I dare not look up but I think the light is dimming. [SNIPPET] Or even killed? When I realized that only one person was needed to pilot Gilgamesh—it was the greatest relief I ever experienced. Now you say...."" His voice picks up suddenly. "" Lizzie, you're beaten anyway."
2378,"The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She pointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child. ""Food!"" [SNIPPET] A tall, beautifully dressed and shaped brunette brushed aside a little man who was trying to talk to her and strode into the room. Her green eyes narrowed like a cat's after a bird. ""Which of you is the geneticist?"" she demanded, and then to George, ""You ... you must be ... you aren't dressed like a business man. Your suit is five years out of style."" Abashed, George looked at himself. "" What's wrong with it?"""
2379,"The computer runs these analyses for both sides, so we can see what's happening to Them, too."" The CIA man gestured impatiently. "" War games simulations aren't new. You've been doing them for years."" ""Yes, but this machine is different,"" Ford pointed out. "" It not only gives a much more detailed war game. It's the next logical step in the development of machine-simulated war games."" [SNIPPET] How can a man with any conscience at all direct a military operation when he knows that that will be the consequence?"" The CIA man struck up a cigarette and pulled hard on it. He exhaled sharply. "" Are all the war games ... like that? Every plan?"" ""Some are worse,"" Ford said. """
2380,"The Navy had fought a last-ditch battle to no avail. The balloting was going to be pretty much of a sure thing—the wet water Navy would soon become ancient history. For some reason the admirals didn't look as unhappy as they should. The Naval Department had requested one last opportunity to address the Congress. [SNIPPET] ""Triplets!"" he said. ""Triplets!"" she said."
2381,"He waited. The pilot walked east toward Mozart's Lady. ""Ready, girls?"" ""Ready, Mrs. Moriarity. But couldn't we—well—sort of hang around until we see what happens?"" ""You mean the escaped convict?"" [SNIPPET] It couldn't. It was dead. For the time-period in which his own segment had existed as the third segment's tongue, it had some control over it. It could extend the tongue, and could see through the eyes in the tongue. But then Jerry's segment had fed, had grown, and the parent-segment had died, as had its parent-segments before it."
2382,"Perspiration beaded the faces of both men. Eyer managed a ghastly grin. Jeter's brow was furrowed with frantic thought as he tried to imagine a way out. ""If we could somehow cut our landing gear free,"" began Jeter, ""but—"" ""But it's too late, Lucian,"" said Eyer quietly. "" Look at the window."" They both looked. [SNIPPET] Lucian Jeter and Tema Eyer worked harder than ever, remembering the promise they had made Kress at his take-off. Whatever had happened to him, he seemingly in part had anticipated. And now the partners would go up, too, seeking information—perhaps to vanish as Kress had vanished. They were not afraid. They shared the world's feeling of dread, but they were not afraid. Of course death would end their labors, but there were many scientists in the world to take up where they might leave off."
2383,"In the lane was a blood-stained crowd streaming to the rear. The wounded men were cursing, groaning, and wailing. In the air, always, was a mighty swell of sound that it seemed could sway the earth. With the courageous words of the artillery and the spiteful sentences of the musketry mingled red cheers. And from this region of noises came the steady current of the maimed.  One of the wounded men had a shoeful of blood. He hopped like a schoolboy in a game. [SNIPPET] The two bodies of troops exchanged blows in the manner of a pair of boxers. The fast angry firings went back and forth. The men in blue were intent with the despair of their circumstances and they seized upon the revenge to be had at close range. Their thunder swelled loud and valiant."
2384,"My progress report will certainly bear that notation."" The three men looked at him, and realized there was no irony in his words, no sarcasm, no realization at all of what had truly happened. ""I can see a va-a-ast fleet of no-o-ble ships...."" the senator began to orate. But the roar of the arriving jeep outside took his audience away from him. They made a dash for the bunker door, no longer interested in the senator and his progress report. [SNIPPET] ""Yes, General,"" he answered as though he were no more than a robot. He hardly listened to the general's questions, did not need the report that every radarscope throughout the area had lost contact at the same instant. Somehow he had known that would be true, that it wasn't just his own mechanisms failing. One question did penetrate his stunned mind."
2385,"They entered the premises cautiously, since the roof was in a rickety condition, and any slight concussion might dislodge an avalanche of stones and plaster. While M. Durant stood glancing round him rather impatiently, M. Hersant made a careful scrutiny of the walls. ""Humph,"" he said at last. "" As you so rightly observed, Henri, this is a remarkable case. I have finished my investigation for to-night. [SNIPPET] In my case I know it was so, and I think it was happy also for him; for none could guess that the small cloud seen in the distance like a man's hand was afterwards to rise and darken all his later days. It was a summer of brilliant and continued sunshine; many of the old people said that they could never recollect so fine a season, and both fruit and crops were alike abundant. John hired a small cutter-yacht, the Palestine, which he kept in our little harbour of Encombe, and in which he and I made many excursions, visiting Weymouth, Lyme Regis, and other places of interest on the south coast.  In this summer my brother confided to me two secrets,—his love for Constance Temple, which indeed was after all no secret, and the history of the apparition which he had seen. This last filled me with inexpressible dread and distress."
2386,"He took one of the doctor's sleeping powders, tried to read a dry book on electricity, endeavoured to write a business letter, smoked a cigar, and finally went to bed. It seemed to him that he went all the next day in a dazed, dreaming state, until the moment when he presented himself, after tea, at Madeline's lodgings, and she opened the door to him. The surprise which he then experienced was calculated to arouse him had he been indeed dreaming. His first thought was that she had gone crazy, or else had been drinking wine to raise her spirits; for there was a flush of excitement on either cheek, and her eyes were bright and unsteady. In one hand she held, with a clasp that crumpled the leaves, a small scientific magazine, which he recognized as having been one of a bundle of periodicals that he had sent her. With her other hand, instead of taking the hand which he extended, she clutched his arm and almost pulled him inside the door. ""Henry, do you remember what George Bayley said that night in meeting, about the river of Lethe, in which, souls were bathed and forgot the past?"" [SNIPPET] With a glance of mutual intelligence they hung their hats, each on the one of the row of wooden pegs in the entry, which had been hers as a school-girl, and through the open door entered the silent school-room and sat down in the self-same seats in which two maidens, so unlike them, yet linked to them by so strangely tender a tie, had reigned as school-room belles nearly half a century before. In hushed voices, with moist eyes; and faces shining with the light of other days, those grey-haired women talked together of the scenes which that homely old room had witnessed, the long-silent laughter, and the voices, no more heard on earth, with which it had once echoed. There in the corner stood a great wrought-iron stove, the counterpart of the one around whose red-hot sides they had shivered, in their short dresses, on cold winter mornings. On the walls hung the quaint maps of that period whence they had received geographical impressions, strangely antiquated now. Along one side of the room ran a black-board, on which they had been wont to demonstrate their ignorance of algebra and geometry to the complete satisfaction of the master, while behind them as they sat was a row of recitation benches, associated with so many a trying ordeal of school-girl existence. ""Do you ever think where the girls are in whose seats we are sitting?"""
2387,"She was as sure as ever that he had not loved Miss Dobson; but this only made it the more outrageous that he had died because of her. What was there in this woman that men should so demean themselves for her? Katie, as you know, had at first been unaffected by the death of the undergraduates at large. But, because they too had died for Zuleika, she was bitterly incensed against them now. What could they have admired in such a woman? She didn’t even look like a lady. [SNIPPET] Nothing,” I said, feeling awfully ashamed of myself. He scrutinised my face with wild and withering contempt. “ Just so,” he said, “but if I were to look I could see—there’s no eyes like mine, I tell you.” Again he clawed, pulling at me downwards in his eagerness to relieve himself by a confidential communication. “ Millions of pink toads. There’s no eyes like mine. Millions of pink toads."
2388,"The children in the streets hooted at him. Anthony had always had a healthy hatred for children and dogs, those twin harassers of the unfortunate and the maladjusted. Both run in packs, and both are cowardly attackers. And if either of them spots a weakness he will never let it go. That his father had been a junk dealer was not reason to hoot at him. [SNIPPET] But the dominant motif should be beauty. The impression of expanded vistas can be given by long low walls and parapets."" ""This is the way they've always built them,"" said the other bird. ""Remember to embody new developments,"" I said. "" Just say to yourself, 'This is the newest nest in the world.'"
2389,"What has happened to you? Where have you been? Can't I do something for you?""  Perhaps she involuntarily held out her hands in a gesture of compassion as she spoke. At any rate I had caught them in my own and was clinging to them with an impulse as instinctive as that which prompts the drowning man to seize upon and cling to the rope which is thrown him as he sinks for the last time. [SNIPPET] The only difference is that after the deep sleep which always follows the application of my process we never recall it, that is, if the operation has been successful. It seems to involve no more interference with the continuity of the normal physical and mental functions than does an afternoon's nap."" ""But the after-effects!"" persisted Henry. """
2390,"Get ready to abandon ship."" When the main mass of fuel caught, the rocket would become an inferno. Rip smashed at the escape hatch above his head, grabbed propulsion tubes from the rack, and called, ""Now!"" He pulled the release on his harness, stood up on the seat, and thrust with all his leg power. He catapulted out of the burning snapper-boat into space. Santos followed a second later, and the crippled rocket twisted wildly under the two Planeteers. ""Don't use the propulsion tubes,"" Rip called. "" [SNIPPET] Not much of a safety margin, especially when he wasn't sure how much power the atomic charge would produce. He plugged into the snapper-boat's communicator and called, ""Ready, Santos?"" ""Ready, Lieutenant."" He braced himself against acceleration and flipped the speed control to full power."
2391,"I remember also a night on Central Park, a stag night, when it was raining convulsively and Binder, Bradbury, Hornig, Rocklynne and Darrow all clambered into a rocking boat and swished out onto the glittering water, yodeling popular tunes at the way-way top of their corny contraltos. Binder has a pleasing bath-tub baritone, while Hornig can imitate a frog at the drop of a body. Darrow was strangely silent, but that man Bradbury and Rocklynne set up such a howl that the Park authorities came out in a submarine, thinking that the Loch Ness monster had turned up again. This was all settled when someone pulled the plug and everyone drowned peacefully. Going way back in the cobwebs I seem to recall a letter arriving at an Eastern post-office addressed to Mars. It was returned marked: Insufficient Postage. As I remember Charlie Hornig wrote, on January 9th: ""On Tuesday, February 20th, 1940, I'll be in Los Angeles. [SNIPPET] The first time he attempted eating he was unsuccessful, it wouldn't stay down. In desperation he hammered against the cold glass with his fists until they bled, crying hoarsely, but he heard nothing but his own weak, fear-wracked words muffled in his ears. After some time had elapsed he got so that he could eat, even sleep while travelling back and forth this way. They allowed him small glass loops on the floor and leather thongs with which he tied himself down at nite and slept a soundless slumber without sliding. People came to look at him. He accustomed his eyes to the swift flite and followed their curiosity-etched faces, first close by in the middle, then far away to the right, middle again, and to the left."
2392,"""And you know Czechoslovakia?"" ""I've spent several vacations in the Tatras at such resorts as Tatranski Lomnica since the country's been made such a tourist center of the satellites."" Ilya Simonov didn't understand this trend of the conversation. ""You have some knowledge of automobiles, too?"" Simonov shrugged. "" I've driven all my life."" [SNIPPET] out goes me! I just can't stand writing the stuff the people read today. Everything is science and education."" He ruffled his thick black hair with his fingers and glared."
2393,"Make a note of the observation, and also of the time. You will find a book for the purpose lying on the desk."" I did as directed, and awaited further orders. The silence was so great that I could plainly hear the ticking of my watch laid on the desk before me. At the end of several minutes the professor cried— [SNIPPET] In this experiment we have the germ of a solenoid cannon. The bobbin stands for the gun-barrel, the plug for the bullet-car, and the magnetism for the ejecting force. We can arrange the wire and current so as to draw the plug or car right through the hole or barrel, and if we have a series of solenoids end to end in one straight line, we can switch the current through each in succession, and send the projectile with gathering velocity through the interior of them all. In practice the barrel would consist of a long straight tube, wide and strong enough to contain the bullet-car without flexure, and begirt with giant solenoids at intervals."
2394,"The professor’s voice was strangely calm. “ You may start your motor. I shall do what I can. Though if we only had the sun—” Jim leaped for the cabin. A touch of the starter and the powerful engine came in. Braking his wheels hard, to hold the plane on the ground, he advanced the throttle as much as he dared, and sent a high-tension current surging through the wires the professor had connected with his tube above. [SNIPPET] I'm finished."" One of her slim bare arms went up with a gesture. From the corner of the little house the guard there turned, came inside. Lee turned to the room. The guard entered. """
2395,"grated Tanub. “You write finish for your entire planet if you do,” said Orne. “ I’m not alone. There are others listening to every word we say. There’s a ship overhead that could split open your planet with one bomb—wash it with molten rock. It’d run like the glass you use for your buildings.” “You are lying!” [SNIPPET] Go, now!"" ""Forgive me, sir! At once, sir!"" the latecomer wailed; and scrambled away as the alarm continued to roar. Reuben gasped at the ""sirs"" and looked at his neighbor."
2396,"Spirit.—You are. I.—I wish to know how to proceed to attain this end. For the love which you bear to science, help me! Spirit.—A diamond of one hundred and forty carats, submitted to electro-magnetic currents for a long period, will experience a rearrangement of its atoms inter se, and from that stone you will form the universal lens. I.—Will great discoveries result from the use of such a lens? Spirit.—So great that all that has gone before is as nothing. I.—But the refractive power of the diamond is so immense, that the image will be formed within the lens. [SNIPPET] ""Yea,"" she said, ""for I love him with all my body and soul; and I would have had him love me par amours, and then should I have been his mistress and he my servant; but now shall he be my master and I his servant."" And still was she very wroth.  Quoth the Earl: ""As to the matter of my being King of Meadham, that will I be, whatever befall, or die in the place else. So if thou wilt not do my rede, then must the varlet whom thou lovest die, and at Greenharbour must thou abide with Dame Elinor. There is no help for it.""  She shrieked out at that word of his, and well nigh swooned, lying back in her chair: but presently fell a-weeping sorely. But the Earl said: ""Hearken, my Lady, I am not without warrant to do this."
2397,"Just beneath us there was such a one of great size and luxurious appearance, with its owner, a fat old man, leaning out, half his gross body through the window, and his podgy hand, gleaming with diamonds, outstretched as he urged his chauffeur to make a last effort to break through the press.  A dozen motor-buses towered up like islands in this flood, the passengers who crowded the roofs lying all huddled together and across each others' laps like a child's toys in a nursery. On a broad lamp pedestal in the centre of the roadway, a burly policeman was standing, leaning his back against the post in so natural an attitude that it was hard to realize that he was not alive, while at his feet there lay a ragged newsboy with his bundle of papers on the ground beside him. A paper-cart had got blocked in the crowd, and we could read in large letters, black upon yellow, ""Scene at Lord's. County Match Interrupted."" This must have been the earliest edition, for there were other placards bearing the legend, ""Is It the End? Great Scientist's Warning."" [SNIPPET] She did unbend a little. She put forward a hand—such a gracious, stooping attitude it was—and she pressed back my head. Then she looked into my upturned face with a very wistful smile.  ""No it isn't that,"" she said at last. """
2398,"""I was in a great taking to know what it was had given my poor father such a turn, and when I got in and found him sitting in his chair taking a glass of spirits, and my mother standing looking anxious at him, I couldn't keep from bursting out and making confession where I'd been. But he didn't seem to take on, not in the way of losing his temper. ' You was there, was you? Well did you see it?' ' I see everything, father,' I said, 'except when the noise came.' ' [SNIPPET] Then, reassured by the absolute stillness and by the growing light, I took my courage in both hands and stole back along the path which I had come. Some distance down it I picked up my gun, and shortly afterwards struck the brook which was my guide. So, with many a frightened backward glance, I made for home.  And suddenly there came something to remind me of my absent companions. In the clear, still morning air there sounded far away the sharp, hard note of a single rifle-shot. I paused and listened, but there was nothing more. For a moment I was shocked at the thought that some sudden danger might have befallen them."
2399,"Keeping the little spring gun out of sight in my hand, I waited until the Venusian's back was turned to me, and pressed the trigger. The spring clicked softly. I caught a glint of the needle as it went home in Shad's backside. He went right on dancing as if nothing had happened. The next time he came around the circle, Molock whispered, ""Let him have another one...."" As I started to pull the trigger, the sky seemed to fall down on top of me. A ham-sized Venusian hand smashed me downward. [SNIPPET] But it did find a bombcrater, miles across and it seemed miles deep. There was an accumulation of reddish dust at its bottom, trapped from the thin winds that blew over this half-frozen world. The Lotus went on to Planet Five. The sun, so far out, was very small and its warmth was barely perceptible. But there was vegetation. The surface temperature was above freezing."
2400,"cried Martin, waving his hand to two thin figures on the bank. ‘ In the Old World!’  ‘Or in the next one,’ added Mark below his breath. ‘ To see them standing side by side, so quiet, is a’most the worst of all!’  They looked at one another as the vessel moved away, and then looked backward at the spot from which it hurried fast. The log-house, with the open door, and drooping trees about it; the stagnant morning mist, and red sun, dimly seen beyond; the vapour rising up from land and river; the quick stream making the loathsome banks it washed more flat and dull; how often they returned in dreams! [SNIPPET] Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play at, boy?”  “We played with flags,” I said. ( I beg to observe that I think of myself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)  “Flags!”"
2401,"He muttered, ""You're crazy!"" ""All right, then. I'll show you."" ""Hey! Where are you going?"" ""Down there. [SNIPPET] He was braced for the quick vinegar thrill of planoforming, but he caught her report of it before his own nerves could register what happened. Earth had fallen so far away that he groped for several milliseconds before he found the Sun in the upper rear right-hand corner of his telepathic mind. That was a good jump, he thought. This way we'll get there in four or five skips."
2402,"I'm sorry, Winner—I don't see how we can. Dr. Caulry left specific orders that you were not to be—"" ""The doctor has no control over my personal life."" Brion interrupted. "" I'm not infectious, nor ill with anything more than extreme fatigue. I want to see that man. [SNIPPET] Jon walked quickly from the employment exchange, his long legs eating up the blocks. Good old Alec, he didn't believe in anything he couldn't touch. Perhaps he was right, but why try to be unhappy. The world wasn't too bad this morning—his leg worked fine, prospects of a good job—he hadn't felt this cheerful since the day he was activated. Turning the corner at a brisk pace he collided with a man coming from the opposite direction. Jon had stopped on the instant, but there wasn't time to jump aside."
2403,"At the end of several minutes the professor cried— ""It has changed again: make another note."" ""What is it now?"" ""Sodium. The yellow bands are unmistakable."" [SNIPPET] It seems to me I've heard the name somewhere. Yes, now I recollect. When I was a student at Cambridge, I remember reading a textbook on physics by Professor Nasmyth Carmichael, an American, and a capital book it was—beautifully simple, clear, and profound like Nature herself. Professors, as a rule, and especially professors of science, are not the best writers in the world. Pity they can't teach the economy of energy without wasting that of their readers. Carmichael's book was not a dead system of mathematics and figures, but rather a living tale, with illustrations drawn from every part of the world. I got far more help from it than the prescribed treatises, and the best of that was a liking for the subject."
2404,"News-gatherers, who had been finding it difficult of late to get anything to report, rushed to their instruments. ""Remove the defendant's chains and set him free,"" the priestess-judge ordered in ringing tones. "" The Great God of the Unspeakable Name has revealed to me whom the defendant most loves. As soon as he is freed, seize him and slay him. For the only being he loves is—himself."" [SNIPPET] ""Sh!"" SK540 vanished through the hole. They waited, listening to incomprehensible sounds. Outside it had grown dark."
2405,"The other weasels, who live in the spare bedroom with the colt, were happy enuf till HE arrived, but now THEY are arranging a schism. As you will readily see, something must be done about it before science-fiction collapses and the standard falls trailing into the dust. I suggest that we mobilize, and, to avoid dissension, give everybody the rank of general. Then, first of all, we can march to my house and get rid of that weasel. The Brown One, of course. [SNIPPET] Everything is science and education."" He ruffled his thick black hair with his fingers and glared. ""You should be joyful that the population is at work doing what they want to do,"" Bella beamed. Sam continued muttering to himself. "" They took all the sex magazines off the market first thing, all of the gangster, murder and detective publications. They been educating the children and making model citizens out of them."""
2406,"“One dark night he was galloping home as usual, when all of a sudden the wheel came against some great heavy thing in the road, and turned the gig over in a minute. He was thrown out and his arm broken, and some of his ribs, I think. At any rate, it was the end of my living with him, and I was not sorry. But you see it will be the same everywhere for me, if men must go so fast. [SNIPPET] At last the eventful moment came; the lens was completed. I stood trembling on the threshold of new worlds. I had the realization of Alexander's famous wish before me. The lens lay on the table, ready to be placed upon its platform."
2407,"Any change in the embryo or larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. In monstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's great work on this subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical: thus [12]cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf; colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants. From the facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons. Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth: long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. Hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth. [SNIPPET] ‘Well!’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘ Speak out, Sam.’  ‘Why, the fact is,’ said Sam, with a desperate effort, ‘perhaps I’d better see arter my bed afore I do anythin’ else.’  ‘Your bed!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in astonishment."
2408,"""Yes,"" she said. "" I'm alone."" He went through the apartment, returned to the front room. "" I had to make sure."" He sank into the low divan, covered his face with his hands. She walked toward him. "" You can't stay here,"" she repeated. [SNIPPET] ""I envy your logic. But I can't see it that way. I was considered too good an agent to make a mistake."" ""It's too late to cry over it now. When it is dark I'll contact—a friend—and have the space ship ready."" Horn grinned. """
2409,"I do not think I shall find any truce this side the grave; and beyond, who knows?""  This was the first time John had spoken in this strain, and he seemed stirred to an unusual activity, as though his own words had suddenly reminded him how frail was his state. He called Raffaelle to him and despatched him on an errand to Naples. The next morning he sent for me earlier than usual, and begged that a carriage might be ready by six in the evening, as he desired to drive into the city. I tried at first to dissuade him from his project, urging him to consider his weak state of health. [SNIPPET] In view of this, we are not surprised to learn that the chances were considered several to one in favor of the failure of any given business enterprise, and that it was common for persons who at last succeeded in making a hit to have failed repeatedly. If a shoemaker, for every pair of shoes he succeeded in completing, spoiled the leather of four or five pair, besides losing the time spent on them, he would stand about the same chance of getting rich as your contemporaries did with their system of private enterprise, and its average of four or five failures to one success.  ""The next of the great wastes was that from competition. The field of industry was a battlefield as wide as the world, in which the workers wasted, in assailing one another, energies which, if expended in concerted effort, as to-day, would have enriched all. As for mercy or quarter in this warfare, there was absolutely no suggestion of it. To deliberately enter a field of business and destroy the enterprises of those who had occupied it previously, in order to plant one's own enterprise on their ruins, was an achievement which never failed to command popular admiration. Nor is there any stretch of fancy in comparing this sort of struggle with actual warfare, so far as concerns the mental agony and physical suffering which attended the struggle, and the misery which overwhelmed the defeated and those dependent on them."
2410,"The sylph took it in her delicate hand and began to eat. My attention was so entirely absorbed by her, that I could not apply myself to the task of determining whether this singular plant was or was not instinct with volition. I watched her, as she made her repast, with the most profound attention. The suppleness of her motions sent a thrill of delight through my frame; my heart beat madly as she turned her beautiful eyes in the direction of the spot in which I stood. [SNIPPET] While I was speculating on the singular arrangements of the internal economy of Nature, with which she so frequently splinters into atoms our most compact theories, I thought I beheld a form moving slowly through the glades of one of the prismatic forests. I looked more attentively, and found that I was not mistaken. Words can not depict the anxiety with which I awaited the nearer approach of this mysterious object. Was it merely some inanimate substance, held in suspense in the attenuated atmosphere of the globule?"
2411,"It was this idea that prompted me to get in touch with an old colleague of mine I had known at UC medical school, Dr. Max Hillyard, who was in practice in Utica, New York. LATHAM. With what result? NIEMAND. I was afraid the result would be that my old roommate would think I had gone completely crazy. [SNIPPET] Now, Dr. Niemand, I understand that you have been investigating solar and terrestrial relationships along rather unorthodox lines. NIEMAND. Yes, I suppose some people would say so. LATHAM. You have broken new ground?"
2412,"And, familiar now, they caused no more than a fleeting discomfort. But I think I could never get used to the outward strangeness! The room in a moment was expanding. I could feel the platform floor crawling outward beneath me, so that I had to hitch and change my position as it pulled. [SNIPPET] Whateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly. ""Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun't be so fussy as yew be."" And without saying more he rose and strode out of the building, stooping at each doorway. Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied Whateley's gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window."
2413,"My brother's body lay, or hung, or rested—what term could describe it?—with his stomach across the under side of a large limb a few feet above where he had stood. He was doubled up like a hairpin, his abdomen pressed tightly up against this bough, and his arms, legs and head extended stiffly, straightly, skyward. Getting my scattered faculties and discoordinate limbs together, I made my way to the tree, the gruesome thought entering my mind that Tristan's body had been transfixed by some downward-pointing snag as it was blown up against the limb, and that the strange stiffness of his limbs was due to some ghastly sudden rigor mortis brought on by electric shock. Dazed with horror and grief, I reached up to his clothing and pulled gently, braced for the shock of the falling body. [SNIPPET] That second time he missed, I just gave up entirely; I didn't care any longer. And then somehow I felt such a sense of peace and freedom—there weren't any upside-down things around to torture me, no sense of insecurity. I just was, in a great blue quiet; it wasn't like falling at all; no awful shock to meet, no sickness or pain—just quietly floating along from Here to There, with no particular dividing line between, anywhere. The cold hurt, of course, but somehow it didn't seem to matter, and was getting better when they caught me."
2414,"Too bad. You're too pretty to die."" ""That—that was a message to Lazar."" ""Yes. He'll be here shortly."" Lynn slipped her hand in the pocket of her tunic, brought out a small blaster. [SNIPPET] ""It's too late to cry over it now. When it is dark I'll contact—a friend—and have the space ship ready."" Horn grinned. "" You're still not sure of me?"" ""It isn't that. But you don't belong to my unit."
2415,"""Then—I did nothing to help when I destroyed their fleet?"" ""Unfortunately you wounded two of our mechanics."" ""I'm a traitor, Dr. Kramer. Even when I try I can't redeem myself!"" ""Only on Vinin can you betray an external absolute, Edward. To an Agronian all objective concepts are relative to the subjective interpretations made by each individual. You can only be a traitor to yourself."" [SNIPPET] ""For ten cents?"" ""Okay, ten cents."" She counted out the money to her brother and put on an apron. "" What should I do now, Bob?"" ""Get the salt,"" Bob instructed. He poured sardine oil from the can into the juicer, being very careful not to let the sardines fall in. When he had squeezed the last drop of oil out of the can, he ate all the sardines and tossed the can into the sink."
2416,"I felt I could not bear to behold the look of tenderness in her beautiful face change to one of hatred, upon learning how she had been deceived; and in my agony of spirit, I cried in a voice of deep emotion: ""Ah, Zarlah! I have won you, yet you are not mine! You have loved me, yet I am not loved!"" ""I am yours, and I love you, Harold,"" softly protested a voice at my side. With a start I turned and beheld Zarlah, and for a moment I stood as if gazing at an apparition. [SNIPPET] ""You must go?"" I cried, for I hated to see him leave and it seemed that he had been with me but a moment.  ""The sky is already red beyond those beautiful hills of yours,"" he replied, ""and it will soon be day.""  ""Just one question before you go,"" I begged."
2417,"This is what they had tried to do before, but without success. Venus travels around the Sun at a speed of about 32 miles per second, and takes about 224.5 days to complete the circuit. From where the Magellan took off, it would approach and overtake Venus at a speed a little greater than the 32 miles per second. The days passed swiftly enough. They had developed the pictures taken in the Mercury station, and the engineers and astronomers spent long hours debating their features, matching up what they had seen with what was known about the Andes station. The shining face of Venus grew larger. [SNIPPET] His face cleared. "" How about whirling over there? You could point it out to me."" ""It's really there,"" Tom said uneasily. """
2418,"She looked at the men and nodded her head. The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him from the shack. There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere and cameras clicking. For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay and photographed it from every angle. [SNIPPET] Frederic Flowers had reached his punch line. "" All right, we've traced the razor all the way back to the manufacturing complex which made it. Mr. Tracy, that razor you bought at a discount bargain for twenty-five dollars cost thirty-eight cents to produce."" Tracy pretended to be dumfounded. """
2419,"Harmon asked. ""No,"" Turner said. "" The law prescribes examination before pregnancy but not afterwards. We were married three months later and everybody was very happy. As for the boy looking like me, everyone who has noticed it assumes I picked a donor like myself. It would be a natural inclination."" [SNIPPET] ""Would it make me sterile for long?"" ""Oh no ... no! I wouldn't use pooled serum from all types anyway. You see we make some specific serum when we are testing each donor and it works only against the sperm of that particular man."" ""Then we're all right?"
2420,"At least let me tell you something about this stock,"" pleaded Elon, loyally, despite the wound.  ""Gardy, I've gone into this thing carefully, and if ever a man felt sure about anything I do about this,"" said Monty, decidedly, but affectionately.  ""Take my word for it Lumber can't go any higher. Think of the situation; the lumber men in the north and west are overstocked, and there is a strike ready to go into effect. When that comes the stock will go for a song. The slump is liable to begin any day.""  ""My mind is made up,"" said the other firmly, and Gardner was in despair. "" [SNIPPET] ""I suppose I can go ashore, can't I?"" insisted Bennie somewhat indignantly. "" I'll just take a camping trip then. I'd like to see the big salmon cache up at the forks if I can't do anything else."""
2421,"“Lud! sir, I suppose they talked ’im over. Those Frenchies, I’ve ’eard it said, ’ave got the gift of gab—and Mr. ’Empseed ’ere will tell you ’ow it is that they just twist some people round their little finger like.”  “Indeed, and is that so, Mr. Hempseed?” inquired the stranger politely.  “Nay, sir!” [SNIPPET] I know! I know the sick and impotent hatred of me that is seething in your heart; and I feel for you the pity you pretend to entertain toward me. Yes, I pity you. But what would you have? Frankly, while in many ways an estimable man, you are no fit mate for Patricia."
2422,"He looked forward to a few books to be compiled later, when he had time, for the guidance of Earthmen at some future date: The Flora of Terranova, The Fauna of Terranova. All that was for the distant future. Now he was chiefly concerned with the Terranovans themselves—how they lived, what they thought, what sort of primitive religion they had, and so on. He asked endless questions of his guides, and through them, of the villagers they met; and the more he learned, the more agitated he became. [SNIPPET] Yet she was unshaken now, detachedly able to watch him as if he were some unruly, unintelligent child. I am going to marry him, she had said, and once the words were out, everything else was easy. There were no problems. There was nothing to be afraid of. ""His name is Gregrill,"" she said. """
2423,"I should have killed you last night when I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take them we lose forever."" ""I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never heard of negotiation?"" ""You are a god,"" Maota said. "" [SNIPPET] All at once, conforming to the changeable weather of children's natures regardless of circumstance, their mood had once more turned bright and adventurous. ""Look, Pop,"" Bubs chirped, his round red face beaming now from his helmet face-window, in spite of his undried tears. "" This land all around here was fields once! You can even see the rows of some kind of stubble! Like corn-stubble! And over there's a—a—almost like a fence! An' up there is hills with trees on 'em—some of 'em not even knocked over."
2424,"Up to their bottoms in problems. Juvenile delinquents, climbing crime and suicide rates, the loony-bins full of the balmy, unemployed, threat of war, spending all their money on armaments instead of things like schools. All the bloody mess of it. Why, a man from Mars would be fascinated, like."" [SNIPPET] He reached down to touch . They were gone. He fought down sudden panic. Where can two children, deaf and dumb and blind go in the middle of the night? Not far."
2425,"Darya Alexandrovna would not have let things go so far on such a day had she been present; but she had to support the English governess’s authority, and she upheld her decision that Grisha should have no tart. This rather spoiled the general good humor. Grisha cried, declaring that Nikolinka had whistled too, and he was not punished, and that he wasn’t crying for the tart—he didn’t care—but at being unjustly treated. This was really too tragic, and Darya Alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the English governess to forgive Grisha, and she went to speak to her. [SNIPPET] It seemed, therefore, more than probable that a similar fate had overtaken the larger towns beyond the Shelif.  In the evening the explorers encamped, as previously, in a nook of the shore which here abruptly terminated their new domain, not far from where they might have expected to find the important village of Memounturroy; but of this, too, there was now no trace. “ I had quite reckoned upon a supper and a bed at Orleansville to-night,” said Servadac, as, full of despondency, he surveyed the waste of water.  “Quite impossible,” replied Ben Zoof, “except you had gone by a boat."
2426,"What's more important, they no doubt think of themselves as girls."" ""Even Dr. Burkett? That is—I mean—"" ""Even Dr. Burkett. Here, get into your suit. [SNIPPET] I asked. “No. Are you worried?” “Not exactly."
2427,"Irregular ways I've always hated; I want his death in the weekly paper stated. M Yes, my good dame, a pair of witnesses Always the truth establishes. I have a friend of high condition, Who'll also add his deposition. I'll bring him here. M Good Sir, pray do! [SNIPPET] A quiet spirit worketh whole years long; Time only makes the subtle ferment strong. And all things that belong thereto, Are wondrous and exceeding rare! The devil taught her, it is true; But yet the draught the devil can't prepare. ( Perceiving the beasts.) Look yonder, what a dainty pair!"
2428,"Away they went, over hills and through meadows, covering the ground with astonishing speed. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Red Wagon arrived before Jinjur's house just as that energetic young lady had finished scrubbing the Green Monkey and was about to lead him to the caramel patch.      The Tin Owl gave a hoot of delight when he saw the Red Wagon draw up before Jinjur's house, and the Brown Bear grunted and growled with glee and trotted toward Ozma as fast as he could wobble. As for the Canary, it flew swiftly to Dorothy's shoulder and perched there, saying in her ear: [SNIPPET] Yet Cap'n Bill, noting the look in Trot's eyes and remembering how often she had been protected by unseen powers, did not quite give way to despair.  The great hole in the dark water—now growing nearer and nearer—looked very terrifying; but they were both brave enough to face it and await the result of the adventure.      The circles were so much smaller at the bottom of the basin, and the boat moved so much more swiftly, that Trot was beginning to get dizzy with the motion, when suddenly the boat made a leap and dived headlong into the murky depths of the hole."
2429,"This moon is now my home—I share it with the spirits of all the animals and insects that were once on your earth. And now that we are free from such as you—free to wander anywhere we like without fear of being shot, or caught and caged—we are happy. And what makes us still happier is the knowledge that the majority of men and women will never have a joyous after-state like ours. They will be earth-bound in that miserable world of theirs, and compelled to keep to their old haunts, scaring to death with their ugly faces all who have the misfortune to see them. [SNIPPET] His friend turned. “ What’s the matter, Henry?” he demanded. The youth’s reply was an outburst of crimson oaths.  As he marched along the little branch-hung roadway among his prattling companions this vision of cruelty brooded over him."
2430,"""Dear God!""  They walked slowly around the ragged edges of the crater. Barney bent down and picked a tiny metallic fragment from the pavement. He stared at it and then tapped Johnny on the arm and handed it to him, wordlessly. It was a twisted piece of body steel, bright at its torn edges and coated with the scarlet enamel that had been the color of the Circle T pickup.  Johnny's eyes filled with tears and he shoved the little scrap of metal in his pocket. "" Let's see what else we can find, Barney."" [SNIPPET] That was a relief. He felt, for the first time in days, as if he could think freely. The cowboy said: ""Two,"" and took them. It was Her Majesty's turn. ""I'll take two,"" she said, and threw away the three and four. It left her with the nine of spades and the nine of hearts, and the Jack of diamonds. These were joined, in a matter of seconds, by two bright new cards: the six of clubs and the three of hearts."
2431,"This accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a formidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six Outside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek and Koona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record trip, brought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much. Three were short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. [SNIPPET] And yet it was true. The unseen machine deliberately moved along until it was actually clinging, not to the top, but to the side of the rock. The water appeared to be about five yards beneath, to the right. To the left was the sky, while the center of that strange vision was now upon a similar boulder seemingly a quarter of a mile distant, farther out in the stream. But the fellow at the periscope didn't change position one whit! It was so unreal."
2432,"""Call him. In the meantime, give me everything you know."" ""Well, the governor decided to go to bed early; he was going hunting in the morning. I suppose you know his usual routine?"" Von Schlichten nodded. [SNIPPET] And we talked like cracked crows. We had crawlers. I itch just from thinking about it. And the dirty parts of the dream I won't even tell you."
2433,"There was an old Arabian legend that Allah had made the first tongs and given them to the first smith, because nobody could make tongs without having a pair already. Sonny didn't understand the fan-blower until it was taken apart. Then he made a great discovery. The wheels, and the fan, and the pivoted tongs, all embodied the same principle, one his people had evidently never discovered. A whole new world seemed to open before him; from then on, he was constantly finding things pierced and rotating on pivots. [SNIPPET] There are millions of worlds suitable for them in the Galaxy. They don't need this one which isn't."" ""How do you know? All this is their information again."" ""This I was able to check independently. I am an astronomer, after all."""
2434,"Overton frowned. He was a solid man, not given to fancies. He had a paper to get out every day and that taxed his imagination to the limit. There was no gray matter left for any such idle musings as Jim suggested. What he wanted was facts, and he wanted them right away. “Eggs will do!” he said. “ [SNIPPET] Rainbolt shook his head. ""No,"" he said. "" I think I could guess what it is—I pick up generalized impressions from outside—but I don't really know."" Spokesman Dorn considered that a moment, chewing his lower lip reflectively."
2435,"A sideswipe in the white."" ""Couldn't be too bad in the white,"" Ben broke in, thinking of the one-hundred mile-an-hour limit in the slow lane. ""That's not the problem,"" Control came back. "" One of the sideswiped vehicles was flipped around and bounded into the green, and that's where the real mess is. Make it code three."" [SNIPPET] As it rose, electric motors slid back the roof that covered the pit, and the howling Antarctic winds roared around it. Unperturbed, it went on rising. Inside, Mike the Angel and Chief Multhaus watched worriedly as the meters wiggled their needles dangerously close to the overload mark. The thrumming of the ship as it fought its way up against the pull of Earth’s gravity and through the Earth’s magnetic field, using the fabric of space itself as the fulcrum against which it applied its power, was like the vibration of a note struck somewhere near the bottom of a piano keyboard, or the rumble of a contra bassoon. As the intensity of the gravitational field decreased, the velocity of the ship increased—not linearly, but logarithmically. She shrieked through the upper atmosphere, quivering like a live thing, and emerged at last into relatively empty space. When she reached a velocity of a little over thirty miles per second—relative to the sun, and perpendicular to the solar ecliptic—Mike the Angel ordered her engines cut back to the lowest power possible which would still retain the one-gee interior gravity of the ship and keep the anti-acceleration fields intact."
2436,"Why?"" ""Because this is one of the young of the species. You should know what happens when a trader kills a native young, even accidentally. What's more, if this is the target-point, then we are on the estate of a powerful native. This might be one of his brood."" That was how they entered their present prison. They had carefully burnt away a portion of the thick, stiff covering and it was obvious that the height from which they were suspended was a killing one. [SNIPPET] ""Patamathonga.""  ""Arrides?""  ""Nexothesmodrastica.""  ""Chtheesnohelgnopteces?""  ""Rigamaroo latasentricpropatria!"""
2437,"Everybody spoke at once. "" Wait a minute,"" said Ben. "" Let's take things in order. What was your idea, Mr. Stevens?"" ""Organize regular search parties."" ""And a good idea, too. We don't even need to wait for daylight. [SNIPPET] ""What happened?"" she asked. ""I don't exactly know,"" he said. "" But I do know you suddenly dashed over and clouted me in the face. Then everything went black for what I judge was quite a period of time. I must have fallen off the couch, finally, and broken the wires, which stopped the machine. Anyway, I came to to find you lying beside me on the floor."
2438,"“Well, what should I have done? Counted every tree?”  “Of course, they must be counted. You didn’t count them, but Ryabinin did. [SNIPPET] These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart—watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns.  “Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!” said Nesvítski; “they are within grapeshot range now.”  “He shouldn’t have taken so many men,” said the officer of the suite.  “True enough,” answered Nesvítski; “two smart fellows could have done the job just as well.”"
2439,"Then he made several attempts to signal Jan by tapping on the walls, but he was quite sure that to get a message to her in this way was now out of the question. For a long time he gazed out into the sunlit valley floor from his window. Preparations of some kind were under way. It looked as though the entire population, which must have numbered close to fifteen hundred Space Men all told, was getting ready to move away en masse. Scores of the strange black people were hurrying about, lugging loads of weapons and hundreds of large cylindrical objects into four immense box-like things of dull metal. Several vehicles, resembling machines of the Space Men, but many times larger, were clustered together in a group. It must have been several hours after Shelby had been taken into the space ship that two of Alkebar's people came to his room, carrying between them the unconscious form of the Space Man who had been Jan's and his fellow prisoner during the night of their arrival on Mars. [SNIPPET] And it was the kids who found the first ""tay-tay bug,"" a day after its trills were heard from among the new foliage. "" Ta-a-a-ay-y-y—ta-a-a-a-ay-y-yy-y—"" The sound was like that of a little wheel, humming with the speed of rotation, and then slowing to a scratchy stop. A one-legged hopper, with a thin but rigid gliding wing of horn. Opalescent in its colors. It had evidently hatched from a tiny egg, preserved by the cold for ages. Wise enough not to clutch it with his bare hands, Bubs came running with it held in a leaf."
2440,"Go look in the mirror."" ""Naah."" The dog paddled over to the table. ""What are you going to do, Bob?"" [SNIPPET] ""I don't like to disturb you, Mr. Gretch, but Mrs. Burroughs is a little upset over the way you acted today. I think you ought to come down for a cup of tea and get acquainted."" ""I know I was rude,"" he said, looking a little ashamed, ""but I have waited for years for a chance to get to work on my own, with no interference. I'll come down tomorrow, when I have got my equipment set up, and apologize to Mrs. Burroughs then."""
2441,"The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? [SNIPPET] asked Eyer. He was making a distinct effort to regain control of himself. His voice was normal, his breathing regular—and he had spoken thus to show Jeter that this was so. ""Whether we're to be dropped or lowered is all one to us,"" he said, ""since we can do nothing in either case. Twenty feet of fall wouldn't smash us up much."" ""Let's keep our eyes on the ceiling ports and see how this swallowing job is really done."""
2442,"Stepping out into the hall and waving away the guards, Seaton motioned Dunark to lead the way. The other captives fell in behind, as they had done before, and the party walked boldly toward the door of the palace. The guards offered no opposition, but stood at attention and saluted as they passed. As they approached the entrance, however, Seaton saw the major-domo hurrying away and surmised that he was carrying the news to Nalboon. Outside the door, walking directly toward the landing dock, Dunark spoke in a low voice to Seaton, without turning. [SNIPPET] Clothes and body grew effortlessly, the latter apparently without pain, as if the terrifying process were wholly natural. The cars coming into Washington Square had stopped as their drivers sighted what was rising there, and by now the bordering streets were tangled with traffic. A distant crowd of milling people heightened the turmoil. The northern edge was deserted, but in a large semicircle was spread a fear-struck, panicky mob. A single policeman, his face white and his eyes wide, tried to straighten out the tangle of vehicles, but it was infinitely beyond him and he sent in a riot call; and as the giant with the kind, dignified face loomed silently higher than the trees in the Square, and ever higher, a dozen blue-coated figures appeared, and saw, and knew fear too, and hung back awe-stricken, at a loss what to do. For by now the rapidly mounting body had risen to the height of forty feet."
2443,"I live in all the agonies of terror: Every eye which is fixed upon me seems to read my secret and my shame. And you are the cause of those agonies! Oh! When my heart first loved you, how little did it suspect you of making it feel such pangs!  “AGNES.” [SNIPPET] “The Murderers!” She cried—  She started away from the Statue’s Pedestal on which She had been seated, and attempted to escape by flight. Her Companions at the same moment uttered a terrified scream, while Lorenzo arrested the Fugitive by the arm."
2444,"Close by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch. The drops of water splashed up to the green leafy roof, and the clerk thought of the million of ephemera which in a single drop were thrown up to a height, that was as great doubtless for their size, as for us if we were to be hurled above the clouds. While he thought of this and of the whole metamorphosis he had undergone, he smiled and said, “I sleep and dream; but it is wonderful how one can dream so naturally, and know besides so exactly that it is but a dream. If only to-morrow on awaking, I could again call all to mind so vividly! I seem in unusually good spirits; my perception of things is clear, I feel as light and cheerful as though I were in heaven; but I know for a certainty, that if to-morrow a dim remembrance of it should swim before my mind, it will then seem nothing but stupid nonsense, as I have often experienced already—especially before I enlisted under the banner of the police, for that dispels like a whirlwind all the visions of an unfettered imagination. All we hear or say in a dream that is fair and beautiful is like the gold of the subterranean spirits; it is rich and splendid when it is given us, but viewed by daylight we find only withered leaves. [SNIPPET] They prepared it by vigorously encircling it with many pressures. A bench was placed underneath. Their clients sat in a row, and the results obtained there were so marvellous that, in order to get the better of Vaucorbeil, they invited him to a séance along with the leading personages of the locality. Not one failed to attend. Germaine received them in the breakfast-room, making excuses on behalf of her masters, who would join them presently. From time to time they heard the bell ringing. It was the patients whom she was bringing in by another way."
2445,"How does it feel, Scarecrow, to be a Bear?"" she asked, addressing her old friend.  ""I don't like it,"" declared the Scarecrow Bear. "" This brutal form is quite beneath the dignity of a wholesome straw man.""  ""And think of me,"" said the Owl, perching upon the dashboard of the Red Wagon with much noisy clattering of his tin feathers. "" [SNIPPET] You mustn't forget the Love Magnet.""  ""What about it?"" she asked.  ""When the fierce Metal Monarch sees the Love Magnet, he will love me dearly and do anything I ask.""  ""It must be wonderful,"" said Betsy, with awe."
2446,"I've lived with them for years. I know their kind of mind. Who would know it better?"" ""But you...."" ""The human race,"" I said, ""is very young. It's only in the last few thousand years that it has discovered sex as a concept. So like little kids in kindergarten it goes around being embarrassed and snickering. [SNIPPET] Before they could protest, I had pushed the priests out through it. The rest of their clan showed up at the foot of the stairs and made a great ruckus while I finished welding the door shut. Running through the crowd, I faced up to the First Lizard in his tub. He sank slowly beneath the surface."
2447,"""It seems,"" I remarked, ""that the defense is overlooking an obvious point there. I doubt if these three defendants ever, in all their lives, had among them the price of such a weapon."" That, of course, brought Sidney to his feet, sputtering objections to this attempt to disparage the honest poverty of his clients, which only helped to call attention to the point. Then the prosecution called in a witness named David Crockett Longfellow. I'd met him at the Hickock ranch; he was Hickock's butler. [SNIPPET] Vyrko blinked and started again. It still read the same. He took firm hold of the magazine, as though the miracle might slip between his fingers, and dashed off with more energy than he had felt in months. He found Lavra in the hydroponic room. """
2448,"And the S.C.S.—Space Colonists' Supply—wanted its cut for providing equipment, as received elsewhere in the past. Bert Kraskow knew that this must remain dapper Trenton Lauren's aim, in spite of a vast and possibly ruinous investment in manufactured goods that could turn out to be obsolete and unmarketable, in addition to its poor quality. Bert studied Lauren from between narrowed eyelids, weighing his qualities further, judging, ever predicting. Trenton Lauren might hate himself some for the deaths that were his responsibility. [SNIPPET] We always needed a name,"" he remarked. "" How about The Planet Strappers? Hell—if the chairborne echelon of the U.S.S.F. is so slow and picky, let 'em go sit on a sunspot."" ""I need some white paint and a brush, Paul,"" Ramos declared, running into the shop. In a couple of minutes more, the name for the Bunch was crudely and boldly lettered on the sides of both trucks."
2449,"We saw Jack at mealtimes for the next few days, but he didn't talk much. We learned that he was twenty-six, in spite of his looking like a boy in his teens, that he thought Prof. Einstein the greatest man ever, and that he disliked being called son. Of his experiment, he didn't have much to say then. He saw Mrs. Burroughs was a little nervous about his experimenting in the guest room and he assured her it was not dangerous. Before the week was out, we started hearing the noises. [SNIPPET] The Ollie came forward. "" We have been able to repair only one of the six Soths we had on the ship. They are more fragile than we humanoids."" ""They don't look it,"" I said. "" And what do you mean by you humanoids? What's he?"""
2450,"""I don't see any blood. Where's the bodies?"" ""But how did you get in—Butcher?"" The Butcher replied airily: ""A red-headed man talked to me and said it certainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes of carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater and just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but then my sprained ankle had got worse—I kind of tried to get up and fell down again—so he picked me up and carried me right through the usher."" ""Butcher, that wasn't honest,"" Hal said a little worriedly. "" [SNIPPET] Steady, Sally! Here's the office, here's the door. Turn the knob and get it over with . Sally opened the door and stepped into a small, deserted reception room. Beyond the reception desk was a gate, and beyond the gate a large central office branched off into several smaller offices. Sally paused only an instant."
2451,"The turk and the chinaman will buy these to kill missionaries and converts with."" Again, in speaking of God, comparing the God conception to an impossible dream, he continues, ""Strange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane—like all dreams: a God who could have made good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and invented hell—mouths mercy and invented hell; mouths Golden Rules and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him!"" One wonders what the Christian Ethiopians thot when the Christian Italians playfully, and undoubtedly with the sanction of the Holy Mother Church, began to spray them with liquid fire, blast their cities, and mutilate their children with the newest Christian improvements on the Christian weapons of war. They probably couldn't quite understand the logic or the fairness of it, but we must not blame the Ethiopians for failing to comprehend, as they haven't had the benefits of Christian civilization for as long a time as the Italians. Let's put a stop to this shilly-shallying. Let's put these destructive Atheists in their place. The Christians KNOW that God DOES exist. [SNIPPET] One after another of the images of herself floated before her. She put out her hand, but it wasn't a mirror; it was another lady shaking her fingers and saying: ""We're waiting for Mr. Thirkell. Sh!"" ""Ah,"" whispered everyone. The velvet curtains parted. Mr. Thirkell appeared, fantastically serene, his Egyptian eyes upon everyone."
2452,"Good-by!""  ""Good-by, young fellah!"" said Lord John. "" The window's plastered up. You can't open it.""  Challenger stooped and raised his wife, pressing her to his breast, while she threw her arms round his neck. [SNIPPET] Then we distributed the various burdens among us—guns, ammunition, food, a tent, blankets, and the rest—and, shouldering our packages, we set forth upon the more laborious stage of our journey.  An unfortunate quarrel between our pepper-pots marked the outset of our new stage. Challenger had from the moment of joining us issued directions to the whole party, much to the evident discontent of Summerlee. Now, upon his assigning some duty to his fellow-Professor (it was only the carrying of an aneroid barometer), the matter suddenly came to a head.  ""May I ask, sir,"" said Summerlee, with vicious calm, ""in what capacity you take it upon yourself to issue these orders?""  Challenger glared and bristled."
2453,"""You don't dislike me as you used to—you've forgiven me for making you come to Russett—but you still think I'm a cold-blooded manipulator of other people's minds and emotions. So I am; it's part of the job. ""You're quite right to distrust me for that, though. It is the danger of this profession, that we end up by looking on everybody and everything as a subject for manipulation. Even in our personal lives.

I sit back and try to think, honestly, if that crack-brained notion I wrote out last night were going to be tried in dead earnest, would I take a hand in it? The trouble is, hearing M'Clare's voice has convinced me it is a Test, I don't know whether it is testing my courage or my prudence in fact I might as well toss for it. Heads I am crazy, Tails a defaulter; Tails is what it is."
2454,"Along with this I purchased every possible accessory—draw-tubes, micrometers, a camera-lucida, leverstage, achromatic condensers, white cloud illuminators, prisms, parabolic condensers, polarizing apparatus, forceps, aquatic boxes, fishing-tubes, with a host of other articles, all of which would have been useful in the hands of an experienced microscopist, but, as I afterwards discovered, were not of the slightest present value to me. It takes years of practise to know how to use a complicated microscope. The optician looked suspiciously at me as I made these wholesale purchases. He evidently was uncertain whether to set me down as some scientific celebrity or a madman. I think he inclined to the latter belief. I suppose I was mad. Every great genius is mad upon the subject in which he is greatest. [SNIPPET] Seclusion from female society has produced this morbid condition of mind. Compare her with the beautiful women of your own world, and this false enchantment will vanish."" I looked over the newspapers by chance. There I beheld the advertisement of a celebrated danseuse who appeared nightly at Niblo's. The Signorina Caradolce had the reputation of being the most beautiful as well as the most graceful woman in the world."
2455,"After three or four hours spent in these fruitless researches, I would proceed to the Mother's Room, where I was now permitted to enter freely every afternoon, and when there, to remain as long as I wished. It was so pleasant that I soon dropped into the custom of remaining until supper-time compelled me to leave it, Chastel invariably treating me now with a loving tenderness of manner which seemed strange when I recalled the extremely unfavorable impression I had made at our first interview.  It was never my nature to be indolent, or to love a quiet, dreamy existence: on the contrary, my fault had lain in the opposite direction, unlimited muscular exercise being as necessary to my well-being as fresh air and good food, and the rougher the exercise the better I liked it. But now, in this novel condition of languor, I experienced a wonderful restfulness both of body and mind, and in the Mother's Room, resting as if some weariness of labor still clung to me, breathing and steeped in that fragrant, summer-like atmosphere, I had long intervals of perfect inactivity and silence, while I sat or reclined, not thinking but in a reverie, while many dreams of pleasures to come drifted in a vague, vaporous manner through my brain. The very character of the room—its delicate richness, the exquisitely harmonious disposition of colors and objects, and the illusions of nature produced on the mind—seemed to lend itself to this unaccustomed mood, and to confirm me in it. [SNIPPET] It seemed to her that the ground of the oscillating square went up the walls, and that the floor dipped on end like a tossing boat. She was right at the edge, almost hanging, surrounded by vast space. The blue of the heavens suffused her, the air was whirling in her hollow head; she had but to yield, to let herself [258] be taken; and the humming of the lathe never ceased, like an angry voice calling her. ""Emma!"
2456,"Like what language it was that these people wrote their log in that we can be certain the Incognitans won't know."" ""More than that,"" says B, ""we didn't decide who they are or where they were coming from or how they came to crash or anything."" ""Come to think of it, though,"" I point out, ""the language and a good many other things must have been decided already because of getting the right hypnotapes and translators on board."" B suddenly lights up. ""Yes, but look, I bet that's what we're here for, I mean that's why they picked us instead of Space Department people—the ship's got to have a past history, it has to come from a planet somewhere only no one must ever find out where it's supposed to be. Someone will have to fake a log, only I don't see how—"" ""The first reel with data showing the planet of origin got damaged during the crash,"" says Cray impatiently. [SNIPPET] I’ll pay you trespass fees on those two, of course, then I’d like to bargain with you for about four more to go with ’em. Got them all picked out and I can cut ’em out and drive them over to the train soon’s we settle the arrangements.” Barra frowned. “Now, wait a minute,” he protested. “ Of course, I’ll bargain with you for any or all of this herd. But I’m in the breeding and raising business, [p 31] remember. I certainly can’t give away a couple of perfectly good beasts on someone’s simple say-so."
2457,"Now I have here the latest issue of that thrilling comic, not yet in the stationary vending machines. Just give me fifty cents and within five—"" ""Please let me through. I'm her mother."" A young woman in the front rank drawled over her powder-sprayed shoulder, ""I'll get her for you,"" and slithered out on six-inch platform shoes. "" Run away, children,"" she said nonchalantly. Lifting her arms behind her head, she pirouetted slowly before Robie to show how much she did for her bolero half-jacket and her form-fitting slacks that melted into skylon just above the knees. [SNIPPET] Phineas T. Gryce, escaping from his own managerial suite, raged about the city, demanding general cooperation in the stretching of great nets between the skyscrapers to trap the errant loaves. He was captured by Tin Philosopher, escaped again, and was found posted with oxygen mask and submachine gun on the topmost spire of Puffyloaf Tower, apparently determined to shoot down the loaves as they appeared and before they involved his company in more trouble with Customs and the State Department. Recaptured by Tin Philosopher, who suffered only minor bullet holes, he was given a series of mild electroshocks and returned to the conference table, calm and clear-headed as ever. But the bread flight, swinging away from a hurricane moving up the Atlantic coast, crossed a clouded-in Boston by night and disappeared into a high Atlantic overcast, also thereby evading a local storm generated by the Weather Department in a last-minute effort to bring down or at least disperse the H-loaves. Warnings and counterwarnings by Communist and Capitalist governments seriously interfered with military trailing of the flight during this period and it was actually lost in touch with for several days. At scattered points, seagulls were observed fighting over individual loaves floating down from the gray roof—that was all. A mood of spirituality strongly tinged with humor seized the people of the world."
2458,"So one summer day when the circus stopped at a small town where I was taking vacation, I was overjoyed at the opportunity to see them. I timed myself to get there as the afternoon performance was over, but arrived a little early, and went on into the untopped tent. Tristan waved an inverted greeting at me from his poise on his trapeze, and I watched for a few minutes. There was an odd mood about the crowd that day, largely due to a group of loud-mouthed hill-billies from the back country—the sort which is so ignorant as to live in perpetual fear of getting ""something slipped over,"" and so disbelieves everything it is told, looking for something ulterior behind every exterior. Having duly exposed to their own satisfaction the strong man's ""wooden dumbbells,"" the snake charmer's rubber serpents, the fat woman's pillows, and the bearded lady's false whiskers (I don't know what they did about the living skeleton), these fellows were now gaping before Tristan's platform, and growing hostile as their rather inadequate brains failed to cook up any damaging explanation. ""Yah!"" [SNIPPET] Navigator Norris took his pipe from his mouth and nodded. His face was expressionless. There was no indication in the man's voice that he had suffered another great disappointment, his sixth in less than a year. ""We'll go back now,"" he said, ""and we'll try again. There must be some planet in this system that's inhabited. But it's going to be hard to tell the women."""
2459,"Even as I looked the sun itself appeared, and in the space of fifty seconds it was high in the heavens. In fifteen minutes we had covered almost a quarter of the globe, and now it was the middle of the afternoon. The importance of having speedways in which to confine aerenoids, travelling at the terrific velocity of one hundred miles a minute, was obvious, and what could be better adapted to the purpose than these magnificent waterways, which completely cover the surface of the planet with such geometrical exactness, that they have always been a source of great wonder to astronomers on Earth. Thousands and thousands of years old, the method of constructing this gigantic system of canals remains enshrouded in the same mystery to the Martians, as that which surrounds the building of the pyramids in Egypt. I was now made aware of another valuable use to which the canals were put, in fact a most important adjunct to the operation of an aerenoid. The checking of such terrific speed would be impossible, were it not for the water in these canals. [SNIPPET] Although I well knew the fatal consequences of arriving at the observatory too late, and realized that in this slow travelling aerenoid my chances of covering the five miles in time were but slight, so depressed and desperate was I that I gave the matter little thought. Indeed, my mind was entirely occupied with thoughts of Zarlah. Vainly did I search Almos' scientific knowledge for a means of transportation over millions of miles of space. All my theories led to but one conclusion—that no material transit over such an enormous distance was possible. My heart sank within me as I thought how brief my happiness had been."
2460,"Other unlighted lines radiated out in tangential spokes to the north and south along the length of the multi-colored belt of NAT 26. This was just one small segment of the Continental Thruway system that spanned North America from coast to coast and crisscrossed north and south under the Three Nation Road Compact from the southern tip of Mexico into Canada and Alaska. Each arterial cut a five-mile-wide path across the continent and from one end to the other, the only structures along the roadways were the turretlike NorCon Patrol check and relay stations—looming up at one-hundred-mile intervals like the fire control islands of earlier-day aircraft carriers. Car 56 with Trooper Sergeant Ben Martin, Trooper Clay Ferguson and Medical-Surgical Officer Kelly Lightfoot, would take their first ten-day patrol on NAT 26-west. Barring major disaster, they would eat, sleep and work the entire time from their car; out of sight of any but distant cities until they had reached Los Angeles at the end of the patrol. Then a five-day resupply and briefing period and back onto another thruway. [SNIPPET] The radio came to life. ""Philly Control to Car 56."" Clay touched his transmit plate. "" This is Five Six."
2461,"He pushed upward with all his strength, steadily with increasing pressure, until the beads of perspiration turned into gulleys that streamed down his face. Exhausted, he crawled back to his chair and lay across the desk littered with calculations of a landing he would never make. The soft luminescence from the Destiny's nuclear engines crept forward and caressed him. In the aft recroom, Eve and Mary were admiring Joseph's strength in being able to push the heavy couch over Adam's trapdoor. [SNIPPET] The fish move at pre-set speeds.

2462,"On her face all trace of pain had disappeared and now there was the tiny smile that had been hers long ago. Her breathing was even, but light as forgotten conversation. Gently he tried to pry their resisting hands away from hers. The hands fought back with a terrible strength beyond normality. By sheer greater force he tore one of the twins away. [SNIPPET] It has a familiar ring to it, yet I cannot tie it in with any past culture I have heard of."" Jocelyn cut in with the regretful announcement that Mr. Fayliss had another appointment, and called for a note of thanks to him for coming. More applause—this time unrestrained. Fayliss smiled again and swept his eyes around us, as if filled with some amusing secret."
2463,"At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, ""And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."" [SNIPPET] “And shall pay for it without delay,” replied the incensed Brother.  The pious procession had now entered the Abbey; The Door was already closed upon it. The Unknown immediately quitted his concealment and hastened to leave the Church: Ere He could effect his intention, He descried Medina stationed in his passage. The Stranger hastily retreated, and drew his Hat over his eyes.  “Attempt not to fly me!” exclaimed Lorenzo; “I will know who you are, and what were the contents of that Letter.”"
2464,"He returned to the set, and switched it on, without changing its upside down position. The big screen lit almost at once; a pained face appeared, with a large silhouetted hammer striking the image's forehead in a rhythmic beat. ""... Immediate relief from headache,"" a bland voice said, as the pictured face broke into a broad smile. The repairman shuddered, and turned down the sound, staring at the image with widened eyes as he did so. ""Dad, I don't want to bug you,"" the repairman said, his eyes still on the screen, ""only, look. The set is upside down, right?"" ""Right,"" said Mr. Rapp. [SNIPPET] Oh, well—"" They were at sea before Hildigund spoke. Awe was in the eyes that watched him. "" No man could be so brave,"" she murmured. "" Are ye a god?""

Your science cannot cope with the cause—only mine can do that."" [SNIPPET] ""Some of us did refuse to work,"" Rush said softly. "" I did, for one. Perhaps you think that we alone will bear the blame. You are wrong. Sooner or later the stigma will spread to all of the sciences—and to you, doctor. Too many now that you can't save; in a little while the hate will surround you also. When we are gone and they must find something new to hate they will blame you for every malformed baby and every death."
2466,"Mattern found himself looking forward with some impatience to Burdon. When Lyddy had a house of her own that she could take an interest in, he told himself, things would be different; she would be different. This way she was bored much of the time, and boredom is contagious. ""I've 'vised ahead to Capella, dear,"" he told her as they boarded ship, ""and rented a furnished multiplex, so we'll have some place to stay."" ""Yes, honey,"" she said, with a strange lack of interest. She didn't even seem surprised at the size of the ship. Underneath her elaborate makeup, she was pale; her body was trembling. [SNIPPET] And then he jerked his head at Raines. "" You come, too."" He paused in the doorway when he saw there was no need for privacy. "" Where are the other crewmen?"" ""Asleep,"" Raines said.

Although he had not been serious about retiring—he knew that now—he wasn't going to let the hyperspacers push him around. Make her sweat a little, he thought irreverently. [SNIPPET] From what I gather, they can't take it very far. Most of their conclusions had to be based on supposition. The important thing, though, is this: a woman will be sent.

2468,"""Hell, you don't know this way,"" Molock interrupted. "" I doubt if you could do it even if I taught it to you."" He was stalling for time but as he was stalling he was getting his strength back. Personally, it was my opinion that all he knew about dancing he had learned in a dime-a-dance hall in some space port on Earth, but if he wanted to teach this to the Venusians, it was all right with me. ""Show him to me!"" Shad Brisbee screamed. "" [SNIPPET] He thought it over. "" Listen, do you sell anything besides soap?"" ""Not right now, sir. But soap flakes are coming up next week and I think we'll be going into bread in a month or two."" ""Bread?"" ""Yes, sir, bread. Although we'll have to distribute that by truck, and have to have almost hundred per cent coverage in a given section before it's practical."
2469,"Now falls the curtain. Roma fuit. At the time of Isidorus' death in A. D. 636, the beginnings of mediævalism were fully under way. Authorship had disappeared in the broader sense; learning, such as it was, had retired into the monasteries; whilst the populace of the erstwhile Empire, living side by side with the invading barbarians, no longer spoke a language justly to be called classical Latin. [SNIPPET] Soon the shore was left behind, and the huge aëroplane was flying between the two skies—the real sky above and the reflected sky below. Only a thin line from far inland showed dark. All the rest seemed but a universe of air without a horizon or any sign of tangibility. Davis kept his eyes on his instruments, and presently announced: ""I think we're far enough out."
2470,"So I began thus: ""How does your Royal Highness distinguish the shapes and positions of his subjects? I for my part noticed by the sense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some of your people are Lines and others Points, and that some of the Lines are larger—"" ""You speak of an impossibility,"" interrupted the King; ""you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference between a Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of hearing, and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained. Behold me—I am a Line, the longest in Lineland, over six inches of Space—"" ""Of Length"", I ventured to suggest. "" Fool,"" said he, ""Space is Length. Interrupt me again, and I have done.""  I apologized; but he continued scornfully, ""Since you are impervious to argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North, the other to the South. [SNIPPET] Hallblithe wondered and laughed, and said: “Who art thou that deemest me so dear?” Said the man: “Short is thy memory, Son of the Raven, that thou in so little space hast forgotten thy shipmate and thy faring-fellow; who gave thee meat and drink and good rede in the Hall of the Ravagers.” Therewith he laughed joyously and turned about to the three maidens and took them by the hands and kissed their lips, while they fawned upon him lovingly. Then said Hallblithe: “Hast thou verily gotten thy youth again, which thou badest me wish thee?”"
2471,"1707. In former investigations of the action of electricity (821, &c.) it was shown, from many satisfactory cases, that the quantity of electric power transferred onwards was in proportion to and was definite for a given quantity of matter moving as anion or cathion onwards in the electrolytic line of action; and there was strong reason to believe that each of the particles of matter then dealt with, had associated with it a definite amount of electrical force, constituting its force of chemical affinity, the chemical equivalents and the electro-chemical equivalents being the same (836.). It was also found with few, and I may now perhaps say with no exceptions (1341.), that only those compounds containing elements in single proportions could exhibit the characters and phenomena of electrolytes (697.); [SNIPPET] Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists entertain, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that each species has been independently created—is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification. [7] Variation under Domestication. Causes of Variability—Effects of Habit—Correlation of Growth—Inheritance—Character of Domestic Varieties—Difficulty of distinguishing between Varieties and Species—Origin of Domestic Varieties from one or more Species—Domestic Pigeons, their Differences and Origin—Principle of Selection anciently followed, its Effects—Methodical and Unconscious Selection—Unknown Origin of our Domestic Productions—Circumstances favourable to Man's power of Selection. When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature."

Squatting behind the station wagon, to watch the engine, Solomon gingerly pulled the twine to eliminate slack. As it tightened, he tensed, braced himself with a free hand on the wagon's bumper, and taking a deep breath, jerked the cord. Tired legs failed and Solomon slipped backward when the hub cap broke free of the tape and sailed through the air to clang against the wagon's fender.

And if the missiles thus fired could be guided—he could see no reason why not—the A-gun was already obsolete. He sat down on a packing box and mopped his brow although the cellar was far from hot. He said and his voice was unsteady, ""Thanks, MacReedy, I think maybe you have done it."" [SNIPPET] ""It's a point I hadn't considered,"" said the banker, reaching for the brandy. He nodded to himself as he poured it, then looked up at Bezdek and asked, ""But why this—space opera is the colloquial term, I believe? Why not stick closer to real life?"" Bezdek sat back and the slanting smile creased his features again. "" Minorities,"" he said. "" That's why."

He gave a good performance—better than his sisters realized, for inside his mind George was in turmoil. They had given him the compound (true, years before he should have taken it), and nothing had happened. He had felt absolutely nothing; he was immune!

2475,"Off to the east the dawn was breaking, and he saw, as he swept down, its pearly pastel shades blending weirdly with that blinding orange glare. Pressing the trigger now, he drove his screaming plane on with throttle wide—and yes, it was glass!—glass of some sort, that crazy nightmare down there.  “Whew!” gasped Carter as waves of dazing heat rose about him. “ [SNIPPET] Excited, half fearing that his sudden guess might be wrong, Shann slid his hand higher in line with that hollow, to discover a second. The first had been level with his chest, the second perhaps eighteen inches or so above. He jumped, to draw his fingers down the rock, with damage to his nails but getting his proof. There was a third niche, deep enough to hold more than just the toe of a boot, and a fourth above that."
2476,"I never! And from my own brother, too. From now on don't come to me for help with your spoiled brat. Good-bye!"" The door slammed indignantly, his mother chuckled, and there was a spontaneous burst of laughter. [SNIPPET] He said, ""How many people do you plan to send here, Captain?"" The ambassador hesitated. Then he said, ""According to the computations of our experts, taking the population curve during the next twenty-five years into account, there will be seventeen million, three hundred thirty-two thousand five hundred—approximately."" The figure was too large to be surplus, Bliss decided. It sounded to him as if humanity were about to abandon Mars completely."
2477,"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only, and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir."" I turned to leave, then paused briefly. "" You can come along, Farley. I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff."" ""There they are!"" [SNIPPET] If Mecteacher were here, he thought, the orbit wouldn't be so difficult to calculate. He'd explain how to do it. And then, he wondered, would Mecteacher have taught the others how to be deep? Or was depth something inside, something that could not be altered by education? If this were a world with other people, he thought, would my cousins be considered abnormals—or would I? He pondered the question for a moment, then decided, as he had so often in the past, that it was truly the cousins who were the flat ones."
2478,"And as she said it the tube went dark. The sound cut off. ""Damn!"" I swore. "" [SNIPPET] Unsteadily, Lou read it aloud: ""'Somebody who I have sheltered and protected and taught the best I know how all these years last night turned on me like a mad dog and diluted my anti-gerasone, or tried to. I am no longer a young man. I can no longer bear the crushing burden of life as I once could. So, after last night's bitter experience, I say good-by."
2479,"Paresi looked at him sharply. "" Let's hypothesize a child who is afraid of the dark. Ask him and he might say that there's a something in dark places that will jump out at him. Then assure him, with great authority, that not only is he right but that it's about to jump any minute, and what have you done?"" [SNIPPET] ""Oh, Junior,"" Reba said, hugging him excitedly. "" Aren't they cute?"" ""What happened?"" Grampa asked, as dazed as Junior. ""Maybe it was the tonic,"" Four said, ""but I suspect it was the the unpolarized gravity. All of a sudden, Fweep started splitting like an amoeba, over and over."
2480,"he said, looking at me keenly. ""Yes,"" I replied. ""I have been directed to tell you that your visit here is temporary, and that you will be returned to your previous life at the end of a certain period of time which we have not yet calculated precisely. You have been registered with the Bureau, and you are free to come and go as you see fit, but you are not to interfere with anything you see. [SNIPPET] It is not my purpose to detail here all that happened during the time I spent on that world. Most of it had to do with Selda, and our daily expeditions about the world. This is not, after all, a love story, but the account of a very strange experience; and, too, none of it was real. During my last week, a series of strange moods and happenings complicated my life. One day, after a visit to the sea with Selda, we were walking back to our plane across the sand."
2481,"The light revealed the lines of green-and-black diamonds painted on his thighs. The smaller man, also a guard, muttered, ""Have I ever told anything?"" ""You understand, then,"" said Gravgak. "" If anything happens, you'll swear there was an intruder—one of the savages."" [SNIPPET] In short, they loved him for his efficiency, and for himself. Especially (according to the rumors that reached my ears) Omosla. Pretty little Omosla, I fear, loved him with a love that might have overwhelmed a lesser man. But I knew that Split Campbell would not be swerved."
2482,"In spite of her supreme confidence of the moment before, the woman now suddenly realized that this promising interview was destined to end disastrously to her plans. ""I am so obtuse that you will have to explain that statement,"" she said with assumed carelessness; but Irene was now on guard and replied: ""Then our alliance is dissolved. I do not intend, Miss Lord, to betray such information as I may have stumbled upon unwittingly. You express interest in Mary Louise and her grandfather and say you are anxious to serve them. [SNIPPET] The exact circumstances of that interview she never revealed to me, but I knew from her manner when she returned that something she had seen or heard had both grieved and frightened her. She told me only that she had flung herself in an agony of tears at his feet, and kneeling there, weary and broken-hearted, had begged him to tell her if she had done aught amiss, had prayed him to give her back his love. To all this he answered little, but her entreaties had at least such an effect as to induce him to take his dinner with us that evening. At that meal we tried to put aside our gloom, and with feigned smiles and cheerful voices, from which the tears were hardly banished, sustained a weary show of conversation and tried to wile away his evil mood. But he spoke little; and when Foster, my father's butler, put on the table the three-handled Maltravers' loving-cup that he had brought up Christmas by Christmas for thirty years, my brother merely passed it by without a taste."
2483,"He's not even in uniform!"" ""Professor Stein maintains sight contact on the scope and transmits the IFF pulse."" The senator's eyes flashed again beneath heavy brows. His lips indicated what he thought of professors and projects who used them. ""What's IFF?"" he asked. [SNIPPET] I don’t think so. But Bat will tell us if there are. He can see them clearly, I believe.” But there weren’t any more and two weeks later Cliff, Steena and Bat brought the Empress into the Lunar quarantine station. And that is the end of Steena’s story because, as we have been told, happy marriages need no chronicles. And Steena had found someone who knew of her gray world and did not find it too hard to share with her—someone besides Bat."
2484,"We were twenty-five days travelling to Pekin, through a country exceeding populous, but I think badly cultivated; the husbandry, the economy, and the way of living miserable, though they boast so much of the industry of the people: I say miserable, if compared with our own, but not so to these poor wretches, who know no other. The pride of the poor people is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their poverty, in some parts, which adds to that which I call their misery; and I must needs think the savages of America live much more happy than the poorer sort of these, because as they have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas these are proud and insolent and in the main are in many parts mere beggars and drudges. Their ostentation is inexpressible; and, if they can, they love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to the last degree ridiculous, as well as their contempt of all the world but themselves. I must confess I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here, and yet the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very convenient for travellers; but nothing was more awkward to me than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance; and my friend Father Simon and I used to be very merry upon these occasions, to see their beggarly pride. For example, coming by the house of a country gentleman, as Father Simon called him, about ten leagues off the city of Nankin, we had first of all the honour to ride with the master of the house about two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was very proper for a merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, tassels, and cuts and slashes almost on every side: it covered a taffety vest, so greasy as to testify that his honour must be a most exquisite sloven. [SNIPPET] Now we came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship appeared; where the knee was bowed to Jesus: and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name of the true God was called upon and adored; and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave Scots merchant with my first acknowledgment of this; and taking him by the hand, I said to him, “Blessed be God, we are once again amongst Christians.” He smiled, and answered, “Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the name of it you may see very little of the substance for some months further of our journey. ”—“Well,” says I, “but still it is better than paganism, and worshipping of devils. ”—“Why, I will tell you,” says he; “except the Russian soldiers in the garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of pagans.” And so, indeed, we found it."
2485,"Wonder if those people didn't leave any caches here on Three, or what?"" ""Maybe they didn't like cold weather."" Jak grinned. "" More likely, though, either we haven't come close enough to detect it, or else they may only have made a cache on one planet in a system."" ""That's probably it. I've been watching for it all the way in, and 'Annie' didn't chirp at all. [SNIPPET] But with such an unprincipled killer and abject wretch as the one before him, he felt no such compunction. He looked contemptuously down at the thing grovelling at his feet in a very paroxysm of fear. Disgusted, Hanlon turned away, climbed into the motor-trike in which Yandor and his men had come here, and started its engine. As he drove away he impressed a command on those now-slavering beasts, who began bellying toward the helpless Yandor."
2486,"He moved his tray of tools away and trailed the hub cap twine behind the solid body of a big old Ford station wagon. He'd read of scientists in block houses when they shot rockets and was taking no chances. Excitement glistened Solomon's old eyes as what blood pressure there was rose a point or two with happy thoughts. If his idea worked, he would be free of the old cars, yet not destroy a single one. Squatting behind the station wagon, to watch the engine, Solomon gingerly pulled the twine to eliminate slack. As it tightened, he tensed, braced himself with a free hand on the wagon's bumper, and taking a deep breath, jerked the cord. Tired legs failed and Solomon slipped backward when the hub cap broke free of the tape and sailed through the air to clang against the wagon's fender. [SNIPPET] ""Oh yes; this is only the control section. Most of this building is taken up by the circuits, the memory banks, and the rest of it."" ""Hm-m-m."" They showed him finally to a small desk, studded with control buttons and dials. The single spotlight above the desk lit it brilliantly, in harsh contrast to the semidarkness of the rest of the room. ""Since you've never run the computer before,"" Ford said, ""General LeRoy will do the controlling. You just sit and watch what happens."""
2487,"And I want to go home where people don't look at me and say, 'So this is your little Martian!'"" Benton, Sr., put his arm around Tommy's stiffly resistant shoulders. "" Look here, old man,"" he said persuasively. "" [SNIPPET] To say nothing of the great human desire to be 'On the Inside' track or 'In the Know' so that they can bet on the 'Sure Thing'. And so,"" said Delancey, ""we've about twenty thousand human beings full of human nature holding tickets on your three dogs, Joseph. They bet their money because the 'Inside Dope' said that the big fix was in. And I can tell you that what twenty thousand people are going to do to this 'Inside Dope' when their nags run last is going to make Torquemada ask permission to return to life for a Second Inquisition, this time with extrasensory tortures."""
2488,"Like the Spaniards among the Aztecs, he thought. Weaver began to feel gratified, his ego expanding. Experimentally, he waved to the massed ranks of bug things as he passed them. A new explosion of twittering broke out, and a forest of twiglike arms waved back at him. They seemed to regard him with happy awe. ""Thank you,"" said Weaver graciously. "" [SNIPPET] How is the Herr Doktor, by the way, and just what happened to him? Miss Kourtakides merely told me that he'd been injured and was in a hospital in Pittsburgh."" ""The Herr Doktor got shot,"" Doris Rives informed him. "" With a charge of BB's, in a most indelicate portion of his anatomy. He was out hunting, the last day of small-game season, and somebody mistook him for a turkey. Nothing really serious, but he's face down in bed, cursing hideously in German, English, Russian, Italian and French, mainly because he's missing deer hunting."" ""I might have known it,"" Melroy said in disgust. """
2489,"At his age, running was a senseless activity, but walking faster than usual, Solomon took a direct route to his office. From the ceiling of hub caps, he selected a small cap from an old Chevy truck. Back at the engine, he punched a hole in the cap, through which he tied a length of strong twine. The cap was laid on the carburetor flange and stuck in place with painter's masking tape. He then bolted the exhaust manifold over the intake so the muffler connection barely touched the hub cap. Solomon stood up, kicked the manifolds with his heavy boots to make sure they were solid and grunted with satisfaction of a job well done. He moved his tray of tools away and trailed the hub cap twine behind the solid body of a big old Ford station wagon. [SNIPPET] He had no explosives, couldn't weld, didn't finish school and was here, in bed, all night. Then they wanted to see his cars. Through the back door, so he'd not have to open the office, Solomon led the three men into his yard. Once inside, and without asking permission, they began searching like a hungry hound trailing a fat rabbit."
2490,"""I've owed you a serious talk for a long time."" ""You don't have to pay the debt. We don't go in much for being serious, do we? Not so dead-earnest-catch-in-the-throat serious."" [SNIPPET] He slept too much, he ate too much, for a brief period he drank too much—until he found boredom even less attractive with a hangover. He tried to write, but the terrible uncertainty of any future audience disheartened him. Sometimes a week would pass without his consciously thinking of agnoton or the yellow bands. Then he would spend a day flogging himself into a state of nervous tension worthy of his uniquely dramatic situation, but he would always relapse. There just wasn't anything to do. Now even the consolation of Lavra's beauty was vanishing, and she began demanding odd items of food which the hydroponic garden could not supply."
2491,"The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled. Above him the woman looked down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. She pointed down into the pit; spoke exultantly to the child. ""Food!"" said the last woman on earth. THE E [SNIPPET] Guldran's pulse leaped. He yelled again, ""Food!"" The instant that his foot touched the yielding surface of the trap, he knew that he had met defeat. As his body crashed down on the fire-sharpened stakes, he knew too the terror from which the last men of the human race had fled."
2492,"When I reached the gate in the fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a fresh reflection to make on Flora’s extraordinary command of the situation. She passed that night, by the most tacit, and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a false note, the happiest of arrangements, with Mrs. Grose. I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw—I can use no other phrase—so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of this one; in spite of which—and in spite also of the deeper depths of consternation that had opened beneath my feet—there was literally, in the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily sweet sadness. On reaching the house I had never so much as looked for the boy; I had simply gone straight to my room to change what I was wearing and to take in, at a glance, much material testimony to Flora’s rupture. [SNIPPET] ""Now let us try Italian,"" said my uncle; and he said: ""Dove noi siamo?"" ""Yes, where are we?"" I impatiently repeated. But there was no answer still. ""Will you speak when you are told?"" exclaimed my uncle, shaking the urchin by the ears. """
2493,"Caffeine affected my metabolism like a pure alkaloid. The immediate effects weren't the same, but the need ran as deep. I finished the cup. I didn't order another because I wasn't a pure sensualist. I just needed release. Sometimes, when I didn't have the price of a cup, I would look around in alleys and find cola bottles with a few drops left in them. [SNIPPET] Of course there's the resemblance to his mother ... and who could forget the glorious Gloria even after twenty years. But it was the way he moved, and that smile."" He shook his head. "" It'll come to me yet."" They took the belt walk to the parking area and stepped off it at George's car. Moving quietly on its air cushion, the car joined the line-up out on the main road where George locked the controls on to Route 63. The speed rose to eighty and steadied as the car settled into its place in the traffic pattern."
2494,"I took the uncanny little instrument in my hands, whilst Mr. Carmichael ascended a ladder to a kind of loft in the shed. It only weighed a few pounds, and yet I could feel it exerting a strong force to escape. ""Ready!"" cried the inventor, ""now let go,"" and sure enough, the box rose steadily upwards until it came within his grasp. "" I am going to send it down to you again,"" he continued, and I expected to see it drop like a stone to the ground; but, strange to say, it circled gracefully through the air in a spiral curve, and landed gently at my feet. [SNIPPET] One is called to his work by a love for it, and the pleasure he takes in doing it easily and well. If his bent is vague or tardy, he is allowed to change, and feel his way to it by trial. Since the work or vocation is not a means of living, there is no compulsion in it. Their aim is to do right in carrying out the true intentions of Nature. For the same reason everyone is free to choose the partner of his life. They are monogamists, and believe that nothing can justify marriage but love on both sides. The rite is very simple, and consists in the elected pair sipping from the same dish of sacred water."
2495,"Our neighboring territories are likewise unaffiliated. Therefore the Star Watch can intervene only if all parties concerned agree to intervention. Unless, of course, there is an actual military emergency. The Kerak Worlds, of course, are completely isolationist—unbound by any laws except those of force.” Leoh shook his head. “As for the dueling machine,” Massan went on, “Kanus of Kerak has turned it into a political weapon—” [SNIPPET] This isn't anything like the situation I last remember...."" ""He remembers!"" Gregory exclaimed. "" That confirms your first derivation by symbolic logic, and it strengthens the validity of the second...."" The schoolteacherish woman began jabbering excitedly; she ran through about a paragraph of what was pure gobbledegook to Benson, before the man with the arrogant face and the jewelled zipper-pull broke in on her. ""Save that for later, Paula,"" he barked. "" I'd be very much interested in your theories about why memories are unimpaired when you time-jump forward and lost when you reverse the process, but let's stick to business."
2496,"Within, they went to a small room behind the cloak room. But here, in spite of the smooth kindness of the gracious gentleman, Aloys knew that he would never be able to compose himself. He was an epouvantail, a pugalo, a clown, a ragamuffin. He looked at the nineteen-point outline of the address he was to give. He shuddered and he gobbled like a turkey. [SNIPPET] ""Why, man,"" said Barrows, ""you can't walk all over these miles and miles of farm and pick off every one of them beetles. You must know another way."" Rankin drew himself up and stared at Barrows. "" I'm telling you all I feel like telling you."
2497,"""I could think of worse things,"" Reba said. ""I like your spunk, Reb,"" Grampa muttered. ""Speaking of children,"" Junior said, ""where's Four?"" ""Here."" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room, carrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a small box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round, raspberry shadow, rolled Fweep. [SNIPPET] Finally he said, ""Why are you out here? And who is he? What do you want?"" ""I'm from the Duchess of Petra,"" Jon said. "" I've come to take Let to the forest people."" ""Yes,"" said the old man. "" Yes."""
2498,"My uncle breathed heavily, his deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside, and punctuated by another nerve-racking sound of distant dripping water within—for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather, and in this storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose, antique masonry of the walls in the fungus-light and the feeble rays which stole in from the street through the screened window; and once, when the noisome atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and looked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights and my nostrils on wholesome air. Still nothing occurred to reward my watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of apprehension. Then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity, occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan. [SNIPPET] Bring him this way. ""This—way?"" Look ahead. With your mind. Can't you learn? Stung to sudden anger, Hyrst flung out a mental probe with a power he hadn't known he possessed."
2499,"They went on their way, but she did not move. After they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for her, and by main strength put her on the sled again.  In the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals. Hal’s theory, which he practised on others, was that one must get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and brother-in-law. Failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a club. At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the Colt’s revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal’s hip. [SNIPPET] When a halt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to their feet and staggered on.  There came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not rise. Hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked Billee on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw, and they knew that this thing was very close to them."
