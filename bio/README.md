# IN A NUTSHELL

I am a technical writer who has amassed experience in the automotive and the gaming industries. Armed with a bachelor's degree in technical communication, the makeup of my undergraduate education has been built upon courses in user experience, globalization, and localization.  

I find myself burning with passion when it comes to:​

-   translation project management
-   localization quality assurance
-   authoring texts for localization
-   documentation & process improvement
-   overall competency ownership

I am not afraid to take the reins as the sole writer of an organization, but I also love collaborating cross-functionally. I thrive best in environments that are structured, predictable, and fast-paced while encouraging independence and freedom under responsibility.​

A native of Los Angeles, English is my mother tongue and exclusively my working language.

## Pivot

How did I go from technical writer to NLP grad student?

The transition began with a lifelong dream of becoming a linguist, reignited during my first role as a technical writer. While documenting tools and processes, I noticed inefficiencies in how translation quality was assessed. This sparked an idea: what if I could develop tools to assist QA teams in evaluating translations more effectively?

I rolled the dice and applied to The University of Arizona and, somehow to my amazement, got accepted. 

## LET'S GET PERSONAL

### BEGINNINGS

I was born in the 1980s, the fourth and final child of Khmer parents who settled in the United States under political asylum. A multilingual and multicultural upbringing forged a path I would traverse some thirty years later, where I would end up as a writer of sorts on the west coast of Sweden - 5,000 miles away from home, in a climate that is vastly different from the year-round sunshine of my childhood in Los Angeles.

### LEAVING THE NEST

I left California for Stockholm in 2016 for the sake of love. When that dissolved a mere five months after my official move, what was supposed to be a one-year experiment in Gothenburg lasted several more years, punctuating my life with an additional passport and a career I've grown to love.

### FOR FUN

When I'm not buried in software documentation or pull requests, I enjoy cooking, baking, traveling, reading, video games, yoga, and sleeping.
