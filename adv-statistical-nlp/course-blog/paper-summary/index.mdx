## Description

This paper surveys various techniques used to improve natural language processing (NLP) for languages with limited data, known as low-resource languages. The authors explore approaches like data augmentation, distant supervision, and transfer learning, which help models perform better when there isn’t much training data available. The goal of the survey is to provide an organized overview of current methods, highlight the challenges of working with low-resource languages, and suggest areas for future research.

## Motivation

The documentation of underserved languages has been a lifelong interest, and it also coincides with the area of work surrounding my internship site.

#### Description (LLM)

_In the LLM's words, what is this paper about?_

##### Prompt

```markdown
What is "A Survey on Recent Approaches for Natural Language Processing in Low-Resource Scenarios"?

The text appears to be a collection of references and a table summarizing the availability of resources for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks across six languages with varying levels of resource availability. The languages are English, Yoruba, Hausa, Quechua, Nahuatl, and Estonian.

The table shows that English has resources available for all 18 NLP tasks listed, while the other languages have varying levels of resource availability. Yoruba and Estonian have resources available for 13 and 15 tasks, respectively, while Hausa, Quechua, and Nahuatl have resources available for 10, 8, and 6 tasks, respectively.

The text also mentions that some of the resources were automatically translated, and that the quality and size of the datasets vary across languages. The authors note that they do not claim that all tasks marked in the table yield high-performance models, but rather indicate if any resources or models can be found for a language.

Overall, the text appears to be a survey of the availability of resources for NLP tasks across different languages, with a focus on low-resource languages.
```

#### What are the authors proposing?

##### Prompt

```markdown
The authors are not explicitly proposing a new method or approach in this text. Instead, they appear to be providing a survey of existing resources and research in the area of low-resource languages for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

The text seems to be a part of a larger work, possibly a research paper or a thesis, that aims to highlight the challenges and limitations of working with low-resource languages in NLP. The authors are providing an overview of the current state of research in this area, including the availability of resources, datasets, and models for different languages.

The authors may be setting the stage for proposing a new approach or method for addressing the challenges of low-resource languages in NLP, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
```

#### What is the motivation for the work?

##### Prompt

```markdown
The motivation for the work is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it can be inferred based on the context. The authors appear to be motivated by the fact that many languages, especially low-resource languages, lack the necessary resources and datasets to support natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

The authors may be motivated by the following goals:

1.  **Promoting inclusivity**: By highlighting the limitations of current NLP research, which often focuses on high-resource languages like English, the authors may be motivated to promote inclusivity and diversity in NLP research.
2.  **Addressing the needs of low-resource languages**: The authors may be motivated to address the needs of low-resource languages, which are often spoken by marginalized communities or have limited economic resources.
3.  **Improving NLP for all languages**: By providing an overview of the current state of research in low-resource languages, the authors may be motivated to improve NLP capabilities for all languages, regardless of their resource availability.
4.  **Filling the gap in NLP research**: The authors may be motivated to fill the gap in NLP research, which often focuses on high-resource languages, and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and limitations of working with low-resource languages.

Overall, the authors' motivation is likely driven by a desire to promote inclusivity, diversity, and equity in NLP research, and to improve the capabilities of NLP for all languages, regardless of their resource availability.
```

#### What are the results and how do they compare with competing approaches? Is the comparison fair?

##### Prompt

```markdown
Unfortunately, the provided text does not include any results or comparisons with competing approaches. The text appears to be a survey of existing research and resources in the area of low-resource languages for NLP tasks, and it does not present any original results or experiments.

Therefore, it is not possible to evaluate the results or compare them with competing approaches. Additionally, since there are no results or comparisons presented, it is not possible to assess whether the comparison is fair or not.

However, if the authors were to present results and comparisons in a future version of the text, here are some potential aspects to consider when evaluating the comparison:

-   **Fair comparison**: Is the comparison fair and unbiased? Are the competing approaches evaluated under the same conditions and using the same metrics?
-   **Reproducibility**: Are the results reproducible? Are the experimental settings and hyperparameters clearly described, and are the results reported in a way that allows for easy replication?
-   **Statistical significance**: Are the results statistically significant? Are the differences between the approaches significant, and are the results reported with confidence intervals or p-values?
-   **Comparison to state-of-the-art**: Is the comparison to state-of-the-art approaches? Are the competing approaches the best available, or are they cherry-picked to make the authors' approach look better?
-   **Evaluation metrics**: Are the evaluation metrics relevant and comprehensive? Are multiple metrics reported, and are they aligned with the goals of the task or application?

By considering these aspects, it is possible to evaluate the fairness and validity of the comparison and gain a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the authors' approach.

### Experience using the LLM

While HuggingChat effectively summarized the paper, its initial responses lacked specificity and sometimes inferred details not explicitly stated in the text. For example, the LLM misinterpreted parts of the motivation, assuming a broader focus on equity without contextual evidence from the paper.

To address this, I iteratively refined my prompts by:

1. Specifying the task: Adding context about the survey's scope to guide the LLM.
2. Requesting structured outputs: For example, asking for bullet points for clarity.
3. Validating responses: Comparing LLM text with the source material to ensure accuracy.
 
#### Errors and limitations of the LLM 

1. Vague responses: The LLM sometimes generalized motivations or results, requiring me to cross-reference the paper to verify its claims.
2. Lack of domain depth: While the LLM excelled at high-level summaries, it struggled with nuanced academic details, such as specific model comparisons or technical explanations.
